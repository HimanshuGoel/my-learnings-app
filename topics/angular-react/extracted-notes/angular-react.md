# Extracted Notes

## Angular

- Binding expression {{}}

- Modules provide some sort of container for the code that we write so that it will not leak-out to some other code.

- Modules provide some sort of container for the code that we write so that it will not leak-out to some other code.

- The ngCloak directive allows us to hide portions or all of our page and tell angular a chance to run to go though and parse the HTML and replace the directives or bindings with the actual values which it wants to display to avoid the flashes of unbound HTML on slower computer.

- HTML doesn’t allow forms to be nested but using ngForm directive we can have nested forms to allow creating the smaller sections of the form.

- $compile service – is used heavily internally by angular whenever a page is loaded it uses to look through the directive and process them. We can also generally used them inside directives. $compile return a ‘link’ function in which we passed the scope.

- Using $parse service – it is also similar with the $compile service and used by angular internally. It is used to evaluate and expression and turn that expression into function that can be evaluated against a given context.

- $rootScope – one $rootScope per application. When we create a new scope it is created from $rootScope getting prototypal inheritance. We can inject global data on it. Avoid using it as a best practice.

- Keyboard shortcut: hold down mouse click on history button on browser to see history. Angular will take care of managing history in the browser as we are not actually loading pages but just loading the angular templates.

- If we use ‘&’ means that we will execute this function into the parent scope instead in the isolate scope. ‘=’ means we are expecting an object. The ‘@’ sign indicates that we are going expect a string to be passed in, so we pass a string or an expression using evaluation {{}} operator.

- Understanding Transclusion – it typically refers to taking a portion of a document and embedding it inside a document. In angular we take an HTML and embedded it inside a directive.

- Transclusion - It is like a picture frame. Like frame is completely separate from the picture inside of it. Just set the transclude property to true, and use the ng-transclude attribute inside the template html.

![angular-js-transclusion](./images/angular-js-transclusion.png)

- If we have some HTML content side a directive like below angular will not show it because it is replacing the `<collapsible>` tag with the HTML inside the template, so we need to use transude to true and in template need to specify where it needs to be shown

- We can return from the compile function a link function then that link function will be executed for each element. So compile function runs once and affects all the instances of the directive the same way then the link function runs individually for each directive. Most often when we create a directive we will not create a compile function, typically we can take care of kinds of things that we need to do using the linking function and the template to manipulate the HTML. The angular ng-repeat directive uses the compile function in order to do its work.

- We can achieve the same functionality using link and inside it using compile but it will be expensive because compile will run many times as per ‘for’ loop value.

- Previously Karma called testacular and it is independent of angular, it can used to test other javascript code as well.

- Angular is an opinionated software. It extends HTML vocabulary using the concept of directive.

- It is helpful in creating single page application. Gmail website is an example of single page application. Routing is a key part in writing single page application.

- Angular was originally written by Misko Hevery. Why angular – it is a complete solution and easy to learn. Abstract away complexity and open source backed by google. Highly testable. Benefits – code reduction. Makes forms more interactive using 2 way bindings. Poor API hiding like using directly ng-click. It supports accessibility using ngAria for screen readers and internationalization. Publicly released as version 0.9.0 in October 2010.

- Angular auto do the change detection unlike in other technologies like in asp.net using component.render() where user has to do it which cause many problems.

- Angular use dirty checking as in javascript comparing two objects is very fast operation. Angular watch all events which can change the data like ng-click or service call then run digest cycle, do dirty check and re-render the page.

- Because angular utilize the client side rendering technique, means most of our HTML isn’t sent directly with the page but instead it comes later on. Due to this most search engines almost see nothing of our site because without the javascript rendering the HTML our site has almost nothing to display. If SEO is important to you then need to use some technique like rely on google only, render portions of site of server, or use a pre-renderer.

- React suffer from Frankenstein framework syndrome, means React by itself is really only a rendering engine, it doesn’t do other things like routing or server communication so we need to look around and piece together the different libraries and parts that we ne need to make a complete solution. So need a good architect person to decide which piece will work best. But angular is a complete solution.

- In angular 2 the angular team has completely revamped the framework to move it forward in a way that really wouldn’t be possible without major changes, due to this angular 2 doesn’t have backwards compatibility with angular 1 framework.

- Angular 2 is created keeping performance in mind so it is much faster than angular 1 which is like 5 to 10 times faster. It has simplified the conceptual model and removed the idea of controllers and modules and simplified how services works and removed much of the configuration overhead. Angular 2 is designed to be more mobile friendly and web standards in mind.

- Angular uses dependency injection to make it easy to get a hold of components, or services that can hold encapsulated functionality and data that we can use to build complex application out of small and simple pieces.

- JQuery – Angular included jQuery in its core library for basic selection and manipulation functions. If we give reference of jQuery then it will use its full version. When a directive does need to manipulate the DOM directly, jQuery is a tool used to do it.

- 5 types of services - provider(), factory(), service(), value(), constant()

- The $q service makes it easy to implement async patterns in our app. It is an object which represent the pending result of an async operation. It provides and API to work with promises and deferred objects that return promises to the calling code. when first client make request to server, the server will first create the deferred object using $q, which is used to communicate the status of the async work back to the client. This deferred object will immediately return a promise back to the client. Then client can use promise API to configure a callback function to execute when the work and the service is complete.

- Client side routing doesn’t replace the server side routing. But while using client side routing the call to server is for getting the little bit of information rather than complete webpages and all of it related resources. SPA need client side routing as a means of referring to different locations with the SPA. There still be interaction with server but for partial data.

![angular-js-server-side-routing](./images/angular-js-server-side-routing.png)
![angular-js-client-side-routing](./images/angular-js-client-side-routing.png)

- Hashbang versus HTML5 Mode – this is the default mode. There will be “#” character after the domain name in the URL. All the text on URL after this character will be for client side routing and angular will handle it. The alternate to this mode is HTML mode

- When angular is configured to run in HTML5 mode it attempts to use the browser’s HTML5 history API.

![angular-js-hashbang-vs-html5mode](./images/angular-js-hashbang-vs-html5mode.png)

- Jasmine is a behaviour driven development framework, it gives us mechanism to write and then execute the unit tests in javascript. The describe function provides the logical grouping of the multiple test cases, and the ‘it’ function state the name of the test cases.

- The main ability karma gives us to execute our unit tests via the command line, so instead of every time do switching between browser and text editor we can easily run it in the command line. Phantom JS will allow us to use the headless browser for even faster test feedback.

- Whenever we construct a new date its base value will always be in UTC, it is a time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. If we specify a date without an offset, UTC is assumed. A date instance has two states the UTC time and a local time based on the system settings. These two states cause problems in unit tests.

- TzDate is a wrapper for the native javascript date type to construct date with time zone information. We can setup a time zone that will not change according to the local machine. It is not a complete implementation of date type object. Its main purposeis to create Date-like instances with timezone fixed to the specified timezone offset, so that we can test code that depends on local timezone settings without dependency on the time zone settings of the machine where the code is running.

- Creating directive by using attribute or element are only recommended because other two are easy to overlook while reading HTML. By using attribute it means we are modifying an existing element while if we use it like element then it means we are adding a new object on the page.

- Because HTML is case insensitive so we need to use dasherization or snake casing while using directive name in HTML. We can also use colon or underscore.

- Structural Directive - These types of directives are complex and rarely created. These are also template directives. It modifies the overall HTML structure. Like ng-if it removes the entire element from the DOM unlike ng-hide which only use simple css display rule to none and ng-repeat, ng-switch. They all use transclusion and control where and when the transclusion will be available in the node.

- Types of directives:

  - Component type – it represents some data and its associated HTML and related functionality, and always implemented as a custom element or also called widget. Like buttons
  - Decorator type – most commonly used. It adds additional functionality to an existing tag or modifies that tag’s display. Like ng-click. These are always implemented as an attribute never have template.
  - Structural/Templating type – like ng-repeat. These type of directive manipulates the DOM structurally to produce a display.

- Best Practice: do not use the replace attribute. And always prefix your directive name with some custom project specific text.

- There are three ways by which we can set the relationship among the directive’s scope and containing controller scope, the default is or the directive to share the scope with the containing controller.

  - Shared type

  - Inherited directive scope – if we create new item on the directive then it will be internal to that directive only. To implement this just create a scope property on directive and set it as true. Its parent and proto property will be containing controller scope. False value will be shared scope.

  - Isolated scope – isolated scope can’t see everything on the parent scope, but it can see specific items that we make visible to the isolated scope. Its parent scope will still have the containing container but the proto property would not have the containing controller scope. By using this we will be able to create a directive that is truly reusable.

- We should break a component/directive into multiple small directives. It is just like not to putting all your code in main class but break into multiple classes as per object orientation.

- If we use the '^' then it will look the directive on the parent node, for '?' sign means that directive may not be present then in that case it will give is as null. If we use the '^^' then we only looking on the parent node not on the current node.

- Key factors in building a line of business application – data is an asset, amount of data is significant, number of input/output data fields is significant, data integrity is critical, data visualization

![angular-js-line-of-business-application-structure](./images/angular-js-line-of-business-application-structure.png)

- Bootstrap is a framework for prettifying the web pages, help you build responsive web applications means responsive to changes in layout, it scales to multiple form factors – phones, tablets, laptops and desktops and handle browser differences. It is developed by twitter.

- For routing angular use fragment identifier because it gets processed on client side and doesn’t get submitted on server, so we assign a unique fragment identifier to each view. The ngRoute is based on fragment identifies while uiRouter is based on application states URL fragment identifier is optional in it. Nester routing can provide the navigation for a tab-based set of edit pages.

- Controller should not have more than 5 collaborators means dependency. We can also use the facade class to arrogate the interaction with several collaborator sin to a single collaborator. Value provider can be used to create global data. Controller should be testable by following the guidelines like too many used collaborators will make it difficult, like manipulating the DOM or too many business logic, too much work it will be tough to test.

- Avoid FOUC (flash of un-styled or un-compiled content) – we can avoid that by using ngCloak, ngBind or waiting image. The ng-bind gives us ability to do the same thing as {{}}.

- For bootstrap logic which is required to start the app, should be in app.run().

- We can organize our app using by feature or type. For large project ‘by feature’ would be better or mix with both types. The LIFT principle (locating our code is easy, identify code at a glance, flat structure as long as we can, try to stay DRY). Have below format while writing controller to have ‘above the fold’ concept, and should not have more than 3 level for folder, it should be flat.

![angular-js-lift-principle](./images/angular-js-lift-principle.png)

- 3 categories of modules – angular js modules, 3rd party modules, custom modules (which we create our self).

- Exceptions cannot be avoided entirely but they can be handled gracefully.

- Why to use Angular? Expressive HTML, modularity, Rule based navigation, powerful data binding, testable, popular so better support and help.

- Bower is a NPM for the web components, to get the dependency files.

- Lifecycle - When the page loads it loads our static DOM. Angular JS is then loaded then we have our ‘on content ready’ event that’s fired. Which kicks off, that’s what Angular is listening for. That is the entry point. Then angular looks for the application within the HTML, so that is our ng-app. From there it goes through and compile all of our services, and controller and everything that we have declared on our model basically gets compiled. It then goes through the DOM and says what directives do I have, what are the angular js pieces within the HTML and generate the template. This is the compilation phase. Then it goes back through and it links it together says this template gets this scope, binds it together and we have our view.

![angular-js-lifecycle](./images/angular-js-lifecycle.png)

- $digest() processes all of the watchers of the current scope, $apply() is used to notify that something has happened outside of the Angular JS domain, $apply forces a $digest cycle.

![angular-js-digest-loop](./images/angular-js-digest-loop.png)

- If we use factory then it works on revealing module pattern, and service is worked with ‘.’ dot syntax pattern, in this we are attaching methods and properties to a ‘this’ object. Prefer to use factory.

- Treating HTML as a DSL (domain specific language) – by using directive we can create HTML like DSL which will specify our page functionality.

- DSL – directives allows HTML to be extended into DSL. By creating custom tags in HTML, we can start to show what we are doing and convey it in a way that makes sense for domain experts. HTML becomes very expressive and self-documented. People find DSLs valuable because a well-designed DSL can be much easier to program with than a traditional library. This improves programmer productivity, which is always valuable. In particular it may also improve communication with domain experts which is an important tool for tackling one of the hardest problem in software development.

- Using compile function – it is used to manipulate the DOM prior the link function executing. Angular team choose to break out the compile and link function due to performance reason because in compile angular need to traverse the whole DOM to find the directive that need to be processed. When we use the compile function scope will not be available to us as it is mainly used for DOM manipulation not finding the scope or adding watches.

- Use the compiler function for template manipulation before the directive was actually attached to the DOM. The compile function takes our HTML and scope and put them together. The compile function gets broke into two functions pre and post. What we get from post link, in the compile function, is what we look in the linker which is our scope and HTML together.

- Use Green Sock for javascript HTML5 animations.

- Cookies present problems today, because the browser sends a cookie on every request, even on requests that do not need a cookie to authenticate the user, and sometimes on requests that have been put together as part of a malicious cross-site request forgery, a CSRF. Cookies do not work well with web API that works on a different domain as they are limited to a specific domain. We have more control over token.

- When we use an ng-repeat and you repeat over something like ‘star in stars’ collection from the scope, angular really wants to see distinct values inside of there, so distinct object references, or distinct number values, or distinct strings. So in case like we have an array with empty elements, in order to work with ng-repeat, we need to tell angular to track these elements by index, instead of the values that are inside of the elements.

- Creating stars ratings functionality:

![angular-js-creating-starts-review1](./images/angular-js-creating-starts-review1.png)

![angular-js-creating-starts-review2](./images/angular-js-creating-starts-review2.png)

- Forms are always start off simple, but then the business wants to add rounded corners and cute icons to make the form look friendly and inviting, and the real complexity starts when the business starts adding validation rules to a form.

- Function binding to isolate scope: whenever we use the ‘&’ binding, we are essentially creating a proxy function on our isolated scope, when we invoke this proxy function, angular goes out and looks at the expression here and it figures out how to invoke that expression to get it to work. We have to understand that angular actually understands expressions like this at a very deep level. If we look thorough the angular source code, we will see lots of regular expression to parse things out, and angular even knows the name of this parameter that of this parameter that we want to pass to the method on objects. Angular understands that it needs a value to pass into this function. So when want to invoke these proxy function, we do not want to just pass parameters along, we to want to pass essentially, a hash that tells angular in the expression being used, if there is something with this name value, then pass along what is inside of this variable for that function argument. So we need to use an object literal syntax like below to get a parameter into an expression that is bound to a proxy function on our isolated scope.

- The first version of angular known as Angular JS. Angular 2.0 or above known as just Angular.

- Angular is a tool to help you build interactive websites, you can call it a framework. It provides tools to communicate with the server and to improve the performance, package application, maintain state, organize code/logic, ease display of data, synchronize state as it changes.

- Angular 2 is more standard based (modern web standards), modern (state management, change detection, etc.), more performant.

- Angular releases major version every 6 months, 6 months of active support and 12 months of LTS support (only security and bug fixes, no new features unlike active support).

- Universal benefits – reduction of cost, standards compliance, extremely performance, open source, use typescript, backed by Google, very uniformity (make onboarding new developers cheaper and simpler), amazing documentation.

- It indirectly provides environment for router, HTTP, forms, RxJS, etc. Already configured with Typescript no need extra to configure, opinionated means fewer decisions to take. Provides support for progressive web apps, lazy-loading, fully reactive forms library support, fully featured router, animations library, supports strictly typed forms.

- Angular also supports server-side rendering, mobile friendly, angular language service (Intellisense and better debugging in templates).

- Components – building blocks of modularity. It breaks up display of application in manageable chunks. It has display and logic.

- Services are a place to put logic which is not related with the display like checking more than article reading limit has been crossed or not.

- Directives are a way to give existing tag a new functionality like making elements or appear on hove, control the visibility, etc.

- Pipes is used, to format the data to display like uppercase.

- Modules are not optional in angular 14. It is a grouping of other features like services, components, pipe and directives, it can also include other modules.

- Application state gets changes on user interaction, http service response or by timer execution.

- Efficient change detection – first the state gets change then cascading changes occurs and finally re-render of page.

- Inefficient change detection – the system is not smart enough to identify the cascading changes and re-render the UI multiple times.

- Zone.js is a wrapper on the things which can change the state change like user interactions, http and timers, it knows when these things gets completed. Angular then subscribed to notification from zone.js so that it can run the change detection and re-render the display.

![Angular Zone](./images/angular-zone.png)

- Rendering targets provided by angular – browser/DOM, server-side, native mobile apps, native desktop apps.

- Angular CLI solves JS fatigue problem which setting up the JS environment to build an application.

- Server side rendering – increase performance as initial download size gets reduced, increase render time, search engine optimization. Modes – full pre-render, dynamic pre-render, client-side switch.

- To build the native mobile apps with angular, there are two common tools ionic and NativeScript. For Native desktop, we need to use Electron.

- Angular testing utilities – TestBed – helpful in testing component with templates. It helps to constructs component in small, live, angular environment and gives us handles to wrapper around component and DOM created by its model. Async and fakeAsync, MockBackend.

- AOT – browser needs to compile the templates into DOM Functions i.e. the actual views. The AOT does it during the compile time itself.

- In chrome browser, Elements, console, sources tabs are called panel and windows inside each of them are called pane.

- In chrome browser, Use $0, $1, $2, $3, $4 to evaluate currently or previous selected elements from console.

- Angular 1 is an MVC pattern, but Angular 2 is component-based pattern, it is like a directive in angular 1 but smoother.

- The interpolation {{}} represents one-way binding.

- Using template reference variable to interact with child components – this variable allows us to specify a variable name that points to a component and then we can access any public properties and method on that component using that variable.

- Angular need to know the exact URL where our app is hosted, so that it can knows what its routes are relative to so that it can parse the URL. For this we need to provide the base tag in our index.html.

- Content project is an ability to change the content inside of a component based on the needs of the application. Like a dialog box and reuse it with different pieces of content for save and cancel button or re-posting logic. This is called transclusion in angular JS. In multiple slot projection we have more than one slot into which the variable content can go. We need to use ng-content tag which will tell angular whatever content exists inside of my component, put it inside of it.

- Mutability – objects and arrays in JavaScript are mutable; they can change any time without changing their identity. By default, angular only runs a pipe when the identity of the source has changed. Using impure pipes, it runs on every cycle of the change detection engine, this method of executing the filtering or sorting code every time change detection runs is how angular JS filter worked. Pipes are no longer recommended as the way to filter and sort our data. We should do it ourselves using component so that we can filter and sort the data when source gets changed by ourselves.

- We should not use global objects of third party services inside the application, if we do this then we won’t be able to use concepts ES6 modules, tree shaking, and also it is bad practice.

- Angular dependency injection lookup – whenever we provide a class into providers, angular takes it and provide an instance for that class using constructor function. In angular 1 we use strings to register the dependencies, in angular 2 we are using classes or types, that is our keys or in other words our token.

- Using OpaqueToken for dependency injection, angular 2 provide a mechanism for us to create a key or token that we can use in the dependency injector without creating a class. Its job is simply to create a token used for the DI registry in order to find the instance of the object we want.

- The useExisting and useFactory Providers – whenever somebody will ask for the MinimalLogger they will get the instance of the Logger, but they will see only those methods that are on minimal logger API that you actually want to use. useFactory allows us to parameterize the creation of an object. We use this when we need to have a very complex way to construct an instance of a class to use as a service.

- Angular HTTP testing utilities – HttpClientTestingModule, HttpTestingController. TestBed utility configures the environmental to run our unit tests, it also implements angular inject interface due to which we can inject the classes which we need in our test.

- For integration test angular use TestBed utility to construct the component, unlike unit test where we ourselves construct the component, in integration test angular does that using TestBed. It also constructs a module for us to be used in the test run for the component to operate in a realistic environment.

- Using a Testbed – Using fixture gives us a hold on the component, but not just its class with its method and properties but also its template, the actual HTML template. We can inspect the template, change it, ask angular to run change detection and expect, this is also a main benefit of testbed to able to get a hold of this fixture. Also using Testbed, we can setup the dependencies in a bit of an easier way. Testbed is also just an angular module.

- Using debug element – debugEl has a query method which we can use to select from the root node using “By” predicate.

![angular-debug-element](./images/angular-debug-element.png)

- Tree shaking removes the properties and functions from production build code that is never called.

- Enable production mode by calling enableProdMode(), the development runs an extra step though angular 2 change detection process. When it’s all done running change detection, it runs it one more time to make sure that nothing has changed. So, in production mode we want to disable this feature.

- Ahead of time compiler (AOT) benefits – in this precompiling our application like compiling template. We need to install compiler itself from platform-server. With AOT we cannot use full path but relative path. It provides faster rendering, fewer requests, detect template errors, better security.

- Optimistic bundle download – eager lazy loading of the module. It will download it as soon as there is available download. We do not want to wait to render the application until it is downloaded.

![angular-preload-all-modules](./images/angular-preload-all-modules.png)

- If we set schemas: [NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA], it means we are testing shallow components, so angular won’t give error any error as it won’t render the child components. In provider if we use useClass or useValue then while doing dependency injection it will pass the instance of that class or value.

- For change detection angular is used zone library, zone listen all the asynchronous activity in a zone. It has a queue of asynchronous activity that it listens for and it waits until it finishes. So we can utilize this concepts using testbed to be able to know when these asynchronous activity is finished versus doing a “done” call-back as in traditional approach.

- The nativeElement property exposes the regular old browser’s DOM API to work with template. There is an another property called debugElement() it is like nativeElement() and it has a way to access to root element of our template. It has some different set of functionalities that is very similar to nativeElement.

- To make the ngOnInit() method to get called as a lifecycle event we need to raise changeDetect() event. We can manually call ngOnInit() but it is not recommended approach.

- Using the fakeAsync helper function to avoid slowness and increase readability. We can use tick() function to call any code that should be called inside of that time-frame, then we can call our expect() statement. The reason we can do this is because angular itself runs inside of zone.js and fakeAsync function makes this code run in a special kind of zone, that zone.js will create that allows us to essentially control the clock inside of that zone. So, we can tell it to tick forward.

- Fake Async in the tests – we need to wrap the test in fakeAsync method, it allows us to fake time. Using tick() method to fake time while using fakeAsync. Working with Async – it helps us to wait for while selecting any DOM to do test deep / child component as integrated test. We use a method fixture.whenStable() for this type of testing.

- If we don’t know the actual tick times then use flush() it will make zone.js to run all the pending tasks in its queue.

- Using the async helper function – it works with promises. Promises are also asynchronous. It also utilizes the same concept of zone.js. it is also a part of angular core testing module. It will ask our component to wait until it has stabilized. The component understands when it sees a promise inside of itself that hasn’t yet been stabilized until that promise resolves. But async() doesn’t deal well with setTimeouts.

- fakeAsync can work with both a promise and a setTimeout and with all other asynchronous types of code. But async is only works well with promises. We should prefer using fakeAsync approach.

- Interceptors allows us to write a small bit of code figure in a single place and apply to all of the HTTP request and responses. They are like services and implement the HttpInterceptor interface. They manipulate HTTP requests before they are sent to the server. They also manipulate the responses before they are returned to our app. Uses for interceptors – adding headers to all requests, logging, reporting progress events, client-side caching.

- Types of directives – component, attribute directive, structural directive. An attribute directive changes the appearance or behaviour of a DOM element. It makes DOM more dynamic, responding to run-time environments and quick & easy to reuse.

- structural directives - `*ngIf`

- Pipes modify data for display only. types - async, currency, date, decimal, json, lowercase, percent, slice, titlecase, uppercase

- Query decorator - if template is inside view then use @ViewChild otherwise @ContentChild if template is inside component

![angular-query-decorator](./images/angular-query-decorator.png)

- Directive selectors

![angular-directive-selectors](./images/angular-directive-selectors.png)

- Native element using cautions – it tight couple our back-end code with front-end presentation, it is unavailable in angular universal, and we cannot move any logic directly using nativeElement into a web worker. So, if we use it property then these problems will not arise. For this we should use Renderer2 class.

- Building templates with ngTemplate – by default it’s just add an empty element as comment `<!---->` on DOM. We can also use it with ngIf-then-else condition:

![angular-ng-template](./images/angular-ng-template.png)

- NgTempalteOutlet – by this we can decide the position of template to display on the DOM, other use-cases can be alternate UI, repeated UI elements, dynamic UI placement:

![angular-ng-template-outlet](./images/angular-ng-template-outlet.png)

- ngTemplateOutlet Context: we can pass some JSON which will alter the templateOutlet, it is useful for simple template modification scenarios:

![angular-ng-template-outlet-context](./images/angular-ng-template-outlet-context.png)

- Dynamic component creation - `*ngComponentOutlet`, `ComponentFactoryResolver`, `resolveComponentFactory`

- Use ng-container wherever possible instead of div or span.

![angular-ng-container](./images/angular-ng-container.png)

- ngSwitch Bloat – instead of this use NgTemplateOutlet:

![angular-avoid-switch-bloat](./images/angualr-avoid-switch-bloat.png)

- A pipe shouldn’t do a lot, for this a component will be a better choice. All built-in pipe are pure, except - splice, json, async

- A better ngFor while iterating collections using trackBy function so that while manipulating the collection angular don’t have to re-create it on the DOM

- Angular lifecycle hooks – the blue blocks hooks don’t available in directives only in components:

![angular-lifecycle-hooks](./images/angular-lifecycle-hooks.png)

![angular-lifecycle-hooks-playground](./images/angular-lifecycle-hooks-playground.png)

![angular-lifecycle-hooks-playground2](./images/angular-lifecycle-hooks-playground2.png)

- Angular treats the UI as a DMZ, accessible to anyone untrusted and un-trustable. Angular treats all values as untrusted by default. Angular only trusts template HTML, binding expressions, and attributes. It will sanitize or cleanse any content it doesn’t trust before adding it to the DOM. It will still display it like a script by converting first into simple string text so that browser doesn’t parse it.

- View child - it is like getElementById() method.

- We can create three types of services to share the data – property bag, basic statement management of entities, and state management with notification. For advance we can use redux.

- For change detection we can use the timer pool if the property is not binding by angular expression:

```typescript
onOnInit() {
    timer(0, 1000).subscribe(t => {
        console.log(this.prod);
    }
}
```

- angular communication approaches

![angular-communication-approaches](./images/angular-communication-approaches.png)

- Angular Material is a reference implementation of Google’s material design specification. It provides a set of reusables, well tested, and accessible UI components based on Material Design. It supports Asymmetric acceleration and deceleration which create more natural and delightful motion than symmetric motion:

![angular-asymmetric-acceleration-and-deceleration](./images/angular-asymmetric-acceleration-and-deceleration.png)

- The goal of angular CDK is to give developers more tools to build awesome components for the web. This will be especially useful for projects that want to take advantage of the features of Angular Material without adopting the material design visual language.

![angular-flex-layout-model](./images/angular-flex-layout-model.png)

- AOT Compiler – improve performance, earlier JIT process compile the functions in DOM functions it takes time. But now using AOT it directly sends the DOM function without compiler.

![angular-jit-process](./images/angular-jit-process.png)

![angular-jit-process](./images/angular-aot-process.png)

- We get the below CORS error unless the URL’s match, including the ports themselves:

![angular-cors-error](./images/angular-cors-error.png)

- Pure and impure pipe performance – pipes are pure by default means they do not work with data mutation, they only get re-evaluated if the object reference got changes that the pipes is applied to. We can resolve this by making the pipe impure but it will impact the performance. Like even initial loading of page this sorting pipe will be called many times due to object changes

- While doing interpolation we can’t use assignments, it only allows read-only data.

- If we don’t want to use brackets () for event binding then we can prefix it by “on”, like on-click.

- Content projection is same as transclusion in angular 1.x, now we use term ng-content tag for it

- Lifecycle hooks - Constructor() – only dependency injection will happen in this step, ngOnChanges() – anytime an input property changes this lifecycle hook gets called, ngOnInit() – input properties have been initialized, ngDoCheck() – when we are working with change detection, when input property gets changes if we want to perform our own change detection, ngAfterContentInit() – when the components or directives content has been initialized, ngAfterContentChecked() – content has been checked out and we are being notified that the checking is complete, ngAfterViewInit() – when the components view has been initialized, ngAfterViewChecked() when view gets checked, ngOnDestroy() – gets called right before the instance gets destroyed and we can free up any resources we have.

- Module organization – Core module should contain single use classes or singleton for the entire application, it should be imported only once in app module. We should have one more module i.e. AppRoutingModule for containing routing related information. Shared module should contain modules which are re-exported and shared throughout the app.

![angular-module-organization](./images/angular-module-organization.png)

- Unit Test – jasmine is main testing framework, and karma is the framework that executes our tests.

- If we want to take up the control while newing up the instance of the recipe class, we need to create a factory that will be executed to create a new service instance. By this we will have more control for how it is created:

![angular-use-factory](./images/angular-use-factory.png)

![angular-use-factory2](./images/angular-use-factory2.png)

- SkipSelf decorators to make sure it is properly checking for a separate input of the core.module. SkipSelf tells the injection system to begin looking for an existing instance of the module in the parent injector. Optional instructs the injector to pass in null if no other instance is found.

- The execution will become pause at the await keyword, so we need to use async keyword in function method name so that it will not block the caller of this function.

- RxJS is a library for building asynchronous applications with observable sequences. It provides an API layer which abstraction different implementation of synchronous, async, single value or multiple value responses. RxJS is written in TypeScript.

- Subscribe method returns a subscription object, by this object we can cancel the execution of the observable. When we cancel an observable by unsubscribing from it, we won’t get a completion message that can be handled by the completion handler we write, but tear down code will still runs when we unsubscribe to prevent the memory leaks in the code.

- Subjects and multicast, they enable multiple observers to receive values from the single execution of an observable.

- Subjects – they are observables. They are implemented as a child class of the observable class. They can also act as observers. They have a state and maintain a list of observers. Due to which they can push values to more than one observer at a time. This makes them multicast instead of unicast.

- Subjects are similar to observables but have a few important additional features. Observables can only produce values for a single observer, so they are unicast. Since subject can produce the same value for multiple observers, they known as multicast.

- Multi-casting operators – multicast() it takes subject as a parameter, it returns a connectableObservable type on which we need to call method connect(). The refCount() operator can be used with other multi-casting operators to automatically trigger execution of the source observable when the number of observers is greater than 0. The publish() operator is thin wrapper around multicast that doesn’t require us to pass it a subject. It will create one for us behind the scene. The share() operator is similar to using publish and refCount together.

- A scheduler controls when a subscription starts and when notifications are delivered. Observables can be configured with schedulers to control the execution context for the observable. Types – queueScheduler (for sync operations), asyncScheduler, asapScheduler (micro tasking).

- Schedulers give us control on how our observables are executing. queueScheduler, asyncScheduler, asapScheduler, animationFrameScheduler, TestScheduler.

- Understanding Schedulers and the Event loop: microtask queue has high priority than async task queue.

![angular-scheduler-and-event-loop1](./images/angular-scheduler-and-event-loop1.png)
![angular-scheduler-and-event-loop](./images/angular-scheduler-and-event-loop.png)

- Using flatMap to process inner observables – flatMap operator is more sophisticated than map operation, it will also subscribe to the returning observable and deliver it throughout the rest of the pipeline.

- In decorator we pass configuration objects that basically stores metadata, all this metadata is used to describe some object that follows like in below Class, Decorator is a feature of Javascript.

- RxJS is the reactive implementations of the Reactive Extensions API. The ReactiveX API is meant to help us to manage the flow of data in our app. RX is a combination of the best ideas from the observer pattern and the iterator pattern. The observer pattern – key things are subject and observer or observables and observers.

- Benefits of RxJS - It has a better asynchronous API, it has both readability and capability of handing multiple values. Callbacks, promises and async-await are only better for handing a single value.

- Libraries are supplemental pieces of functionality, they help us solve specific problems, but don’t dictate the overall architecture of our app. Ideally, they avoid conflicts with other libraries and let us selectively use their features as we see fit. Examples are RxJS, lodash, jQuery. Framework on the other hand are much larger and prescriptive. We typically only use choose a single framework to use when starting work on a new application, however we might supplement that framework with several libraries to help us with specific problems we are trying to solve. Example – angular, react, Vue.

- RXJS operators

![angular-rxjs-operators](./images/angular-rxjs-operators.png)

- Types of observables – cold (Netflix / movie @ home) and hot (movie theatre)

- observeOn – use different scheduler as javascript has multiple queues. This operator explicitly let us specify which queue on observable will processed on, means it let us specify a priority for the new values coming out of an observable.

- subscribeOn – it is similar to observerOn, it changes observable scheduler used by source observable.

- Multi-casting - Taking values from source and sharing or passing them along to multiple subscribers, typically placing some type of control or limit on how the subscribers receive values or the values they receive.

- Core and shared module – core or common module is designed for singleton type of services, which will be shared throughout the service like logging service, error service and data service. Service that are specific to a feature can go in the feature’s folder. Shared folder should contain reusable components, pipes and directives like calendar component, auto complete component. Shared module will be imported many times in different modules, but core module should be imported only one time into root module.

![angular-module-organization2](./images/angular-module-organization2.png)

- Change detection strategies – in case of container presentation pattern, we don’t want the child component changing the state of the data at all, because that is the job of the parent or container component. When using OnPush detectors, then the framework will check an OnPush component when any of its input properties changes, when it fires and event, or when an observable fire an event.

- Reference vs. Value types – if our container component passing a value type it would update the child because change detection mechanism would catch, but when we do changes in some object property i.e. referenced type because object itself didn’t change and change detection won’t get fire, so to handle this we need to use cloning techniques.

- State management options – angular service, NgRx, ngrx-data, observable store, Akita, Ngxs, MobX

- A service is typically a class with a narrow, well-defined purpose. It should do something specific and do it well.

- HttpClient and RxJS operators – use forkJoin when we want to call two HTTP service and know when both of them come back and completed, it is like promises.all.

- General architecture of application with libraries

![angular-general-architecture-with-libraries](./images/angular-general-architecture-with-libraries.png)

- The best way to test our angular library is to use npm pack command which is used to change directory into the library dist folder. We need to type command cd my-folder/dist then npm pack. It will create a tarball file (`*.tgz`) then we can install it using npm install my-folder/dist/package.tgz. other alternatives to test the library on local are npm install, npm link, but npm pack is best approach.

- Push based architecture using RxJS and Facades. Traditional pull based – we call them once, they respond, they are done. They are not going to return values over the future. Push based services – we construct a stream like user stream using another stream that will extract our users out whenever that state changes. Our views react to that change of data from that stream.

- For a state management we need single source of truth, immutable state that is needed for things like ngOnChanges so it can fire properly as it will only get fires when the reference will change, state change notification and track state change history and simple to implement and maintain, works with any front-end framework. To satisfy all of these things we can use observable store. It provides a simple way to manage state ina front-end application while achieving many of the key goals offered by more complex sate management options

- NgRX selectors - allow us to query our store for data, recompute when their input change, full leverage memoization for performance, selectors are fully composable, selectors are extensible

- Jest is built on jasmine, it uses snapshot which reduce test code and compares results with snapshot. By this the snapshot gets checked-in into the PR which reviewer can see and take decision whether it is make sense for which we are making against take PR.

- Effects are about controlling asynchronous operations and allow us to dispatch action based on this asynchronous operations.

- NgRx is a library, it is not a framework or another platform. NgRx supercharges the redux pattern with RxJs.Redux pattern is a state management container, it came from React community. The reducer will take the slice of state from action and create a new state. We don’t put HTTP service in the reducer as HTTP service call is not a pure function, it is a side-effect as it can return anything. We use effect for this situation, this effect is listening for all actions that are being dispatched in our application.

- Redux attempts to make state mutations predictable by imposing certain restrictions on how and when updates can happen. Three core principles – single source of truth by one big store, state is read only, pure functions drive state changes

- For communication between components, we need to action and selectors. As one component raise the action then reducer update the store and both components subscribe to that select which will make the components re-render.

- Now we can use `changeDetectionStrategy` onPush, it will optimize our view performance. It means that the change detector’s mode will be initially set to CheckOnce. Any asynchronous API events like XHR or promise based events will not trigger change detection once we change to this strategy of OnPush and the components template will not get updated. In default strategy it will every time changes in our application as a result of any user events, timers, XHR requests, promises, etc change detection will run on all components.

![angular-without-change-detection-on-push-approach](./images/angular-without-change-detection-on-push-approach.png)

![angular-without-change-detection-on-push-approach](./images/angular-without-change-detection-on-push-approach.png)

- Now above component will be changed only if new input reference is passed or a dom event is raised in our component or its children otherwise the view will not get updated.

- Angular language service main features – hover tooltip (quick info), go to definition, code completion Intellisense, diagnostics, syntax highlighting. It will automatically shows the properties which are available if we type [], and available events if we type () on a `<div>` element. Angular language service is built on top of Language Server Protocol (LSP) which makes is editor agnostic.

- Benefits of rendering the application on server-side using Angular universal – show the first page quickly, improve performance, facilitate web crawlers (SEO).

- On console if we type ‘ng’ it will give us below methods –

![angular-ng-console-functions](./images/angular-ng-console-functions.png)

- Angular CLI Builders - Builder are wrongly given name, they just know that they are just given a set of options, run a function and return the results.

- The term ‘state’ is kind of fancy term for saying the data in your application that changes like list of movies. A side-effect is a term that we use to describe code that has to talk to the outside world like making REST calls, handling a web socket connection or dealing with time, these side-effects generally triggered by like ‘search’ button call. The term state change is the act of after we subscribe and get the movie list result, we update that component is managing to the results that came back from the API request.

- Selectors are consumers of action, but their responsibility is to help you bind your state to your components, it helps to bind state to our components. We have actions as some kind of indirection that allows a component to talk to the store without actually having to directly inject the store. Selectors are just functions. Selectors are like Global @input() for our application. Components don’t know how that state is derived or where that state comes from, their only responsibility is to subscribe to those selectors to be notified when that data changes, using async pipe in template which will automatically subscribe to that observable and then unsubscribe when the component is destroyed.

- Actions are unified interface to describe events, it just have data, no functionality, has a minimum a type property, strongly typed using classes and enums. This is the main communication layer between so many independent pieces of the application. It is how components are going to be describing events, and it is what reducers and effects are going to be using to trigger state changes and to trigger side effects. Unique events get unique actions, actions are grouped by their source, actions are never reused. Mention what caused it to happen, and who produced it.

- Optimistic UI is where we remove the records from the UI at once by assigning some temporary ID and then after getting call from server we update it, it makes UI more user friendly.

- If a user goes away from the desk for couple of hour, to avoid the stale data we can use web-sockets which will dispatch method in our backend that can notify clients when changes to our data model occur, and then using NgRx effects connect to that web socket and map notifications coming out of that web socket connection into actions that can then go update state by this we are always getting a live UI.

- To implement session expire functionality that to show message like ‘this is going to expire after certain minutes of time’ we can do it by setting up an effect that on enter could run like every minute of five minute or every hour to re-trigger that HTTP request and rehydrate the store if we don’t want to go the web socket method.

- To clear the data if user logs out, we can trigger the logout action and trigger state change that could pass undefined to our reducer and have them all clear.

- Effects are where all our side effect producing code happens like showing alerts, starting timers, opening connections to web socket, making http calls.

- Instead of having one heavy reducer function, we should have smaller reducer functions to update just slices of our state.

- Actions are like gluten of the NgRx loaf. We use unified interface to describe events. The ‘type’ property is the name of that event and it needs to be unique across all the actions in our application.

- Selectors allows us to query our store for data, they are almost like our SQL statements from a database.

- Anyone below we can use in effects. Exhaust map will discard any additional emission until one that is currently working on is complete, it is like going to postoffice and the front person is taking too much time and leave in-between. switchMap is opposite of exhaustMap, it will cancel the current work if new effect comes up. mergeMap, exhaustMap and switchMap can lead to raise condition as they are either cancelling the requests or discarding the new runs so concatMap is the safest operator but there is risk of back pressure and it will keep the emissions in order, it will lead to bad user experience of waiting. It is like waiting in a queue to get food, and we will only get the food when priors persons received the food.

![angular-map-use-case2](./images/angular-map-use-case2.png)

- Usage of RxJS operators in different scenario –

![angular-rxjs-operators-different-scenarios](./images/angular-rxjs-operators-different-scenarios.png)

- takeUntil is like throwing a person out of lunch line but everyone else will just continue. exhaustMap is like no line will ever perform, if someone is buying a lunch the other will just went away from there and never comes back.

- We can use interval operators in scenario where we want to refresh a page within some duration. Also instead using the web-sockets we can use this to rehydrate our models.

- Monorepos – everything that belongs to a system should get in there and it should have one version for all of these libraries not different version for different libraries by this we won’t have version conflicts, no burden with distributing lists

![angular-monorepos](./images/angular-monorepos.png)

- Earlier compiler used to build the packages also if someone changes something in a project file, but now ngcc compiler will compile the package separately to make the build process faster. No more JSON conversion of typescript components.

- Faster tests – smarter recompilation model, earlier using view engine it will compile all of the components between every single test execution, but with Ivy unless we use some override method it won’t compile all of the components.

- HttpBackend will be last interceptor –

![angular-interceptor-sequence](./images/angular-interceptor-sequence.png)

- Firebase was initial created to integrate online chat functionality. Google acquired it into 2014. Cloud functions can be triggered from different firebase services, google cloud services or even third parties through web hooks.

- Types of errors – external (HttpErrorResponse), business side and internal (Javascript error).

- When an Angular application is started, the main.ts file is loaded first, here we bootstrap the root module i.e. app.module.ts. In this module, we specify a component as the bootstrap component and tell angular to load this component and all its dependencies at start up and register it’s selector app-root. Now when browser loads the index.html file, it knows what is app-root and render all the contents of this component.

- The Bazel compiler is a build system used for nearly all software build at Google. When you compile the code with Bazel Compiler, you will recompile the entire code base, it compiles only with necessary code. It uses advanced local and distributed caching, optimized dependency analysis and parallel execution. In short, it only rebuilds what is necessary.

- @Inject is a manual way of specifying this lookup token.

- Injector tree – an angular application is a tree of components. Each component instance has its own injector. The tree of components parallels the tree of injectors.

- How angular router works – runs the guards that are defined, resolves the required data, activate the angular components, manages navigation and repeats the steps

- Three types of data bindings – interpolation, event binding, property binding. Interpolation is a one way data binding.

- Angular does not have built-in two way data binding, however, by combining property binding and event binding we can achieve two way data binding.

- Inbuilt structural directives are `*ngFor`,`*ngIf` and attribute directives are `NgStyle` and `NgModel`

- The main.js file contains all the code in our application, the polyfills.js file loads all the polyfill script to make sure it can be compatible with all the modern browsers. The runtime.js loads all the other files. The styles.js file loads the styles as the name suggests and vendor.js file loads all the imported libraries.

- The canLoad guards always blocks preloading, so if the canLoad guard is executed, preloading will not work. We can replace the canLoad guard with the canActivate guard, and the it works perfectly fine.

- React vs. angular - Are you type of developer who prefers guided path where everything is kind of inside of a box and works out of box then choose angular. If you like to deviate from certain patterns and build things your own way like routing and other things then react is suitable for you. So, it is more of the type of developer you are than technology.

- By using `ng serve` it run the application locally in memory by using web pack server. This server is not ideal for the production.

- Instead of using the nested subscriber we should use maps like switchMap, exhaustMap, mergeMap and concatMap they all internal use map operator it has a project function which will return whatever we return whichever we return from it. These above operators use flattening operators like mergeAll, concatAll, switchAll and exhaust so that they don’t return observable of observables but just a normal observable.

- We shouldn’t mock which we don’t own. For the external libraries we should write an adaptor and while writing the external integration tests, use that adapter along with external library.

- We can also store full page and resources locally by using application cache but it is deprecated now, we should now use the service workers and cache API to cache resources. The cache API is a cache object where request objects act as keys to their responses.

- Service workers are scripts that run separately from our web page, intercept network request so web developers can treat the network as an enhancement and contains certain events such as fetch, push and sync. It basically works as a proxy between the network and the browser and a work when we are offline or in the background even when our site is closed, so we can trigger events when our site is closed as-well. Alternative is application cache but it is complicated and has strict rules, inefficient with versioning, cannot update small areas. Due to this the web workers have been introduced in combination with Cache API.

- Service worker expands on web worker, this means that it has no access to the DOM, isn’t tied to a particular page and run on its own global script context, works only with HTTPS, run without a page and is event-driven, it also triggered again even when in inactive state.

![angular-service-worker-lifecycle](./images/angular-service-worker-lifecycle.png)

- What Is an "App"? - Application Richness and Reachability evolution, native app like IOS has increased the richness but reduced the availability.

- Expectations from an app - findable on app store, icon on home screen, touch controls, works offline, receives notifications, background processing, access to hardware feature and sensors.

- The progressive web app is a thing that will give us both richness and reach without compromise.

- Attributes of progressive web app – responsive, work offline, native app-like feeling, fresh and safe, discoverable, re-engageable (push notification), installable, linkable (URL based).

- Baseline requirement for progressive web apps – site is served over HTTPS, pages are responsive on tablets and mobile devices, metadata is provided for add to home screen, the start URL loads while offline, first load fast even on 3g, site works cross browser, page transition don’t feel like they block on the network, each page has a URL.

- The smart component will pass the updated data towards the dumb components

![angular-smart-component-data-passing](./images/angular-smart-component-data-passing.png)

- We should only use behaviors like logging in the tap operator, we should not use side-effects in it.

- It is safest default for flattening, hard to create leaks like mergeMap. We should use it for HTTP request that can be cancelled (GET) and great for reset, pause and resume functionality. We should avoid it with POST request while saving the data.

- Catch errors on observables with catchError – we can either throw an error or return a new observable based on some condition. We can also return the EMPTY observable.

- Difference between [] and {{}} bindings - We can’t mix [] and {{}} together on the same attribute. Angular will complain.. Property bindings are actually manipulating the DOM and they get to preserve data types. Curly brace binding is string interpolation of the HTML and always results in strings.

- It comes down to how they function. {{}} is basically a form of string interpolation. You should think of it as simply replacing the HTML string with the results of the binding, and then the HTML gets evaluated.

- Property binding, [], on the other hand, works differently. You should think of this as manipulating the DOM after the HTML has been processed by the browser.

- So the [src] binding actually manipulates the src property of the image object, and NOT the src attribute of the img tag.

- The difference between ElementRef, TemplateRef, and viewContainerRef with examples.

![angular-element-ref-template-ref-vs-view-container-ref](./images/angular-element-ref-template-ref-vs-view-container-ref.png)

![angular-ng-content-ng-template-ng-container](./images/angular-ng-content-ng-template-ng-container.png)

![angular-ng-content-ng-template-outlet](./images/angular-ng-content-ng-template-outlet.png)

- Angular 2 we have structural directive which are indicated by the prefix `*` because it is changing the structure of our DOM.

- No more $apply, repeated digest cycles, no more watches, no more performance issues with digest cycle and watcher limits.

- @Injectable() is similar to angular 1’s $inject. Now in new case we are using a decorator.

- When we inject a service, angular searches the appropriate injectors for it. Angular 2 has a hierarchical DI system with a tree of injectors that parallel an application’s component tree.

- The great thing about the http object, the service that angular gives us, is when it gives us back the observable it will automatically unsubscribe when it is done. So we do not have to worry about cleaning up that particular one. If we create a manual observable and subscription, then we are going to have to clean up our own subscription.

- Types of guards – resolve, can activate, can activate child, can deactivate, and can load (can load is like can activate but it will not even go get the contents, html and the javascript until it get satisfied it is used in lazy loading).

- We can use tools like AOT, which is an angular tool to do ahead of time compilation that will use the angular compiler on the server to compile the template here and then send across the wire those compile templates. We will use things like tree shaking to shake out some of the dead code that we are not using. Use code splitting so we can split our bundles up in case we use eager or lazy loaded modules. Use bundling and minification. Angular CLI.

- RxJS subjects are like an observable, but they can multicast to many observers, they are like event emitters and they maintain a registry of many listeners or observers.

- Angular universal is a concept that because we are no longer tightly coupled to the browser, because we have this compiler, we can actually build our application, and then render it entirely in a server side. Render it without the browser context at all. In this angular give us single method within what’s called platform server that renders our application to a string. So, we import our root module, and then angular say render to string. We give it the context of the URL the user’s trying to load. Then we can cache, serve or sent the string to the other user.

- A decorator is a JavaScript language feature, the scope of the decorator is limited to the feature it decorates.it is always prefixed by @ sign. It needs to be define above the class signature with no semi-colon afterwards, it is like an attribute feature in other programming languages.

- Observables help us to manage asynchronous data; they treat events as collections. We can think it as an array whose items arrive asynchronously over time. As of now observables are not supported by ES6, angular currently use Reactive Extensions (RxJS) as a third party library for this.

- Observables allow us to manipulate sets of events with operators. Operators are methods on observables that compose new observables. Each operator transforms the source observable in some way. Operators do not wait for all of the values and process them at once. Rather, operators on observables process each value as it is emitted. Operator examples – map, filter, take, and merge.

- Bootstrap array - Every angular application should have one app module, and one app component, it should have one bootstrap component which will be loaded while opening of index.html main file. So, every application must bootstrap at least one component, the root application component. The bootstrap array should only be used in the root application module, AppModule.

- Declaration array – we use this to define the components, directives, and pipes that belong to this angular module. Every component, directive, pipe that we create must belong to one and only one angular module. Do not add other classes, services, or modules to the declarations array. All declared components, directives, and pipes are private by default. They are only accessible to other things in declared in the same module.

- Exports array – allows us to share angular module’s components, directives, and pipes with other modules. Never export a service.

- Import array – an angular module can be extended by importing capabilities from other angular modules. It allows us to import supporting modules that exports components, directives, or pipes. We should only import what this module needs. Importing a module does not provide access to its imported modules.

- Providers array – it can register service providers for our application. It allows us to register service providers at the module level. It is like the provider array of component, which register the service at component level. Any service provider added to the provider array is registered at the root of the application and is available to the any class, even classes in other feature modules. Do not add services to the providers array of a shared module. Instead of this we should build a core module for services and importing it once in the AppModule. Routing guards must be added to the providers array of an angular module so that router can use these services during the navigation process.

- If you have set of services that you want to ensure are loaded when the application is loaded, consider defining a core modules for those services. It should be imported once into the root module.

- Different types of modules which we can have: root application module (AppModule), feature modules, shared modules, core module, routing modules

![angular-for-root-vs-for-child](./images/angular-for-root-vs-for-child.png)

- We need to use query parameters to retain the user setting when navigating to the different navigation. To define parameters that work across multiple routes. Like on product list user has some search data, then navigated to the details page then coming to the product list page. Just like optional parameter we use query parameters to pass optimal or complex information. Unlike optional parameters they can be retained across routing paths. Like optional parameters, query parameters are not part of the route configuration and are not involved with matching route paths.

- We can use child routes to display routes within other routes for better route hierarchy, encapsulate and navigate through our application. Also makes easier to lazy load routes.

![angular-lazy-loading-vs-preloading](./images/angular-lazy-loading-vs-preloading.png)

- A form model is the data structure that represents the HTML form – it retains the form state, form value, child controls.

- Creates a FormArray – we can call above created method to create multiple instances of that FromGroup, but we need somewhere to hold these multiple instances, that is the purpose of a FormArray. This array is simply a group of FormControls or FormGroups that are conceptualized as an array. These arrays are great for sets that are dynamic, or of unknown length.

- Building angular – during development time we are more focused on development speed and debugging and efficiency. In production we want to make sure the code is rock solid and secure and as fast as we can get it, even into the bundles/chunks.

- Ejecting – the angular CLI uses web pack under the covers and there is a configuration file to change the web pack configuration using command ng eject. By this we can eject our application and put proper web pack configuration so that we can run thing on our own, we would not be able to use ng build command anymore. Now a new file will be visible by name webpack.config.js. Now we can use npm start.

- When we use a form tag in an angular template, angular 2 is going to add a directive automatically to this form. We access a directive with a template reference variable. We need to have name property on an input field to make it register into angular with ngModel. We should also turn off browser validation to avoid inconsistency while handling error in browser validation using novalidate attribute in form tag.

- There is no guarantee that our model is set up when the blur or change event gets fire, so model might not be updated at that time. So instead of passing the $event model, we should use template reference variable.

- In earlier days while using cookie, another website open in different tab can also access the cookies for first tab. But using token-based protocol like OpenID connect or OAuth 2 it will require to put the token into the authorization header.

- For authenticating the user, we should use a separate server i.e. identity provider. Identity provider are also called SSO server.

- The OAuth access tokens have a fixed expiration time. If they got expired then calling a protected API result in 401 unauthorized. In this case we need to obtain a new token from STS to continue calling API’s. we can’t use OAuth 2 refresh tokens with Implicit Flow.

- Because all browsers do not support the newest version of javascript due to which we will use typescript. It transpile and change into javascript. We can let the browser let the transpile or we can transpile on server.

- Portal CDK – portal outlet - a portal is a piece of ui that can be dynamically rendered to an open slot on the page. this ui can be a component or templateRef. the open slot is a portalHost. tabs, dialog and snack bar uses the portal components. use domPortalHost to attach for an arbitrary DOM element outside of angular application context.

- Reactive extensions were originally developed by Microsoft as Rx.NET. It is a way to observe and react to data as it flows through time. Reactive development is a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of changes.

- For data caching we can use shareReplay and share operators.

![angular-life-cycle-steps](./images/angular-life-cycle-steps.png)

- Angular is a tool to help you build interactive websites, you can call it a framework. It provides tools to communicate with the server and to improve the performance, package application, maintain state, organize code/logic, ease display of data, synchronize state as it changes.

- Angular 2 is more standard based (modern web standards), modern (state management, change detection, etc.), more performant.

- Angular releases major version every 6 months, 6 months of active support and 12 months of LTS support (only security and bug fixes, no new features unlike active support).

- Universal benefits – reduction of cost, standards compliance, extremely performance, open source, use typescript, backed by Google, very uniformity (make onboarding new developers cheaper and simpler), amazing documentation.

- It indirectly provides environment for router, HTTP, forms, RxJS, etc. Already configured with Typescript no need extra to configure, opinionated means fewer decisions to take. Provides support for progressive web apps, lazy-loading, fully reactive forms library support, fully featured router, animations library, supports strictly typed forms.

- Angular also supports server-side rendering, mobile friendly, angular language service (Intellisense and better debugging in templates).

- Standalone component doesn’t reduce work, but just reduce the learning curve for the new person learning angular, need to see what emerges further (new use cases).

- Tools provided by the Nx – ESLint, Cypress, Jest, Storybook, Prettier.

- Note that if your component has no inputs or you use it without providing any inputs, the framework will not call ngOnChanges().

- ngDoCheck - This hook can be interpreted as an “extension” of ngOnChanges. You can use this method to detect changes that Angular can’t or won’t detect. It is called in every change detection, immediately after the ngOnChanges and ngOnInit hooks. This hook is costly since it is called with enormous frequency; after every change detection cycle no matter where the change occurred. Therefore, its usage should be careful to not affect the user experience. Well, since Angular tracks object reference and we mutate the object without changing the reference Angular won’t pick up the changes and it will not run change detection for the component. Thus the new name property value will not be re-rendered in DOM. Luckily, we can use the ngDoCheck lifecycle hook to check for object mutation and notify Angular.

- ngAfterContentInit - This method is called only once during the component’s lifecycle, after the first ngDoCheck. Within this hook, we have access for the first time to the ElementRef of the ContentChild after the component’s creation; after Angular has already projected the external content into the component’s view.

- ngAfterContentChecked - This method is called once during the component’s lifecycle after ngAfterContentInit and then after every subsequent ngDoCheck. It is called after Angular has already checked the content projected into the component in the current digest loop.

- ngAfterViewInit - This method is called only once during the component’s lifecycle, after ngAfterContentChecked. Within this hook, we have access for the first time to the ElementRef of the ViewChildren after the component’s creation; after Angular has already composed the component’s views and its child views. This hook is useful when you need to load content on your view that depends on its view’s components; for instance when you need to set a video player or create a chart from a canvas element

- ngAfterViewChecked - This method is called once after ngAfterViewInit and then after every subsequent ngAfterContentChecked. It is called after Angular has already checked the component’s views and its child views in the current digest loop. If we continue clicking on the Update button many times, the ngAfterViewChecked will be triggered each time, as well as, ngDoCheck and ngAfterContentChecked.

- Note that the ngOnDestroy is not called when the user refreshes the page or closes the browser. So, in case you need to handle some cleanup logic on those occasions as well, you can use the HostListener decorator

```typescript
@HostListener('window:beforeunload')
ngOnDestroy() {}
```

- We can understand the lifecycle hooks by splitting the process into two steps,” first-time hooks”, and “in every change detection cycle hooks”. “first-time hooks”, the triggered hooks are: onChanges, onInit, doCheck, afterContentInit, afterContentChecked, afterViewInit, afterViewChecked. “in every change detection cycle hooks”, the triggered hooks are: onChanges, doCheck, afterContentChecked, afterViewChecked.

![angular-lifecycle-hooks-workflow](./images/angular-lifecycle-hooks-workflow.png)

- How the Angular Compiler Works - The Angular Compiler (which we call ngc) is the tool used to compile Angular applications and libraries. ngc is built on the TypeScript compiler (called tsc) and extends the process of compiling TypeScript code to add additional code generation related to Angular’s capabilities.

- Angular’s compiler serves as a bridge between developer experience and run time performance: Angular users author applications against an ergonomic, decorator-based API, and ngc translates this code into more efficient runtime instructions. In this way, ngc can be considered an extended TypeScript compiler which also knows how to “execute” Angular decorators, applying their effects to the decorated classes at build time (as opposed to run time).

- The ngc has several important goals: Compile Angular decorators, including components and their templates. Apply TypeScript’s type-checking rules to component templates. Re-compile quickly when the developer makes a change.

- TypeScript by itself has no understanding of Angular template syntax and cannot type-check it directly. To perform this checking, the Angular compiler converts Angular templates into TypeScript code (known as a “Type Check Block”, or TCB) that expresses equivalent operations at the type level, and feeds this code to TypeScript for semantic checking. Any generated diagnostics are then mapped back and reported to the user in the context of the original template.

- Angular CLI works fine with either one: kebab case or came case. For my part, in the future we should try to stick to kebab-case because that is what the Angular CLI --help output uses.

```shell
ng new my-app --create-application=false | ng new my-app --createApplication=false
```

- Signals - Either change everything or keep a track which values have been changed which will cause internal housekeeping problems. It is better to tell angular by us which things have been changed for a better performance and predictability. A signal represents a value of some kind either a simple primitive value or something as complex as a list of objects. It will let the angular know if something is changed and what has changed.

- Angular is a single page application which means that the main JS bundle is downloaded from the server, and then the browser handles rendering the different views within the application. Without routing, we can manage changing views programmatically but navigating without changing the URL means that the native browser navigation will not work for our application. By bootstrapping the angular router module we can connect our application to the browser URL, which allows users to move between views using built-in browser functionality. Since angular is a single-page application, changing in the routing are not requesting new views from the server. Instead, route changes will replace portions of the current view.

- Declaring child routes with forChild() as we want to reuses the existing singleton router service instance but want to separate out routes into separate modules to keep our route declarations closer to the components that they route to.

- Path segment prefixing – we should use relative paths whenever possible to avoid large refactors if the parent URL structure changes. Also, we should define constant route tokens instead of using static strings across the application.

![angular-path-route-prefixing](./images/angular-path-route-prefixing.png)

- The navigateByUrl() method is not able to handle the query params or setting the relative URL, the navigate method is more versatile. The navigate() method is default to absolute route.

- The canMatch route guard is very useful for feature flagged routes.

- We should avoid using the route resolvers as they blocks navigation until the function returns, it is not a great solution for prefetching data from slow endpoints and we should avoid to use it.

- In angular 15, we can use RouterTestingHarness to test router links with ease

- Angular’s compiler serves as a bridge between developer experience and run time performance: Angular users author applications against an ergonomic, decorator-based API, and ngc translates this code into more efficient runtime instructions.

- In this way, ngc can be considered an extended TypeScript compiler which also knows how to “execute” Angular decorators, applying their effects to the decorated classes at build time (as opposed to run time).

- ngc has several important goals: Compile Angular decorators, including components and their templates. Apply TypeScript’s type-checking rules to component templates. Re-compile quickly when the developer makes a change.

Any generated diagnostics are then mapped back and reported to the user in the context of the original template.

Innovation is more like a system or network not a single moment.

- Angular inspirations –

![angular-inspirations](./images/angular-inspirations.png)

![angular-angular-inspired-by](./images/angular-angular-inspired-by.png)

- FormControl is an entity that tracks the value and validation status of an individual form control. A FormControl is always created regardless of whether you use template driven or reactive forms. Instead of a native form control like input, any custom form control can interact with a formControl. The number of native form controls is limited, but the variety of custom form controls can be potentially infinite. So, Angular needs a generic mechanism to stand between Angular’s formControl and a native/custom form control. This is where the ControlValueAccessor object comes into play. This is the object that stands between the Angular formControl and a native form control and synchronizes values between the two. A ControlValueAccessor acts as a bridge between the Angular forms API and a native element in the DOM.

- Default value accessors - DefaultValueAccessor, CheckboxControlValueAccessor, NumberValueAccessor, RadioControlValueAccessor, RangeValueAccessor, SelectControlValueAccessor, SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor

- If we try to mutate the state in ngOnChanges() or ngAfterViewChecked() or ngAfterContentChecked(), it will give ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError.

- View encapsulation modes – none, emulated and shadowDom.

- In the default emulated mode - It will add the random **ngHost and**ngContent attributes on the components if we have define some style properties on the component. Otherwise it won’t generate them. By this, these styles will be out from the global scope, this mode is handled by the angular.

- The none and ShadowDom modes will be handled by the browser not by the angular. With none mode, it won’t generate any attributes and the styling given at the component level will be applied on the whole DOM. We can use this mode in the root app component so that all the styles which we apply in here will be applied on all page content globally. With ShadowDom, it will create the actual shadow root element will be created which will separate the marker and CSS outside of the scope of the parent document. This approach will cause problem in older versions of browser.

- We should stick with the default Emulated mode.

- We can apply all the styles globally by externally link the style.scss into angular.json file or by turning off the view encapsulation to none and referring the style.scss into the app component. We should prefer linking them into the styles.scss file

- We should not apply all the styles globally except browser resets, colors, typography, layout, media queries and utilities as no all styles need to encapsulated.

- We have two system to apply global styles – class based system, mixing & variable based system.

- We should name the global class with prefixed like l-container or layout-container or lt-container to avoid collision, but it is not needed for local scoped class like navbar.

- Naming design for CSS – SMACSS, OOCSS, Atomic Design, B.E.M.

- B.E.M. is an acronym for `block__element--modifier`. A modifier would be any variation on a block or element within a block.

- Single responsibility principle - Let’s say you have a component called Order that displays information about a customer’s order, including the customer’s name, order date, and order items. This component has two responsibilities: displaying the customer’s information and displaying the order information. According to the SRP, these two responsibilities should be separated into two separate components. By following the SRP, you can create a well-organized codebase that is easy to maintain and modify. This, in turn, makes your applications more scalable, flexible, and adaptable to changing requirements.

- Open/Closed Principle (OCP) - The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is a software design principle that states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that the implementation of a software entity should be written in such a way that it can be extended to meet new requirements without having to modify the original code.

- The OCP helps to make the code maintainable, extendable, and scalable. By following this principle, you can avoid having to make changes to the existing code base every time new requirements are introduced, which can save time and effort and reduce the risk of introducing new bugs.

- One way to implement the OCP is through inheritance. You can create a base class that implements the common functionality and then extend it with subclasses that add additional functionality. For example, if you want to offer discounts based on customer loyalty, you can create a new class that extends the DiscountService class and overrides the calculateDiscount method to include the customer loyalty factor.

- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) - The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This means that subclasses should be able to extend the functionality of their superclasses while preserving their behavior.

- A violation of the LSP can result in unexpected behaviors and bugs in the program. For example, consider a Rectangle class that has width and height properties. If a subclass of Rectangle called Square overrides the setters for width and height so that changing one also changes the other, then a client that depends on the Rectangle class may not work correctly when it is given a Square object.

- To ensure that the LSP is not violated, it is important to design classes and their hierarchies in such a way that subclasses inherit the behavior of their superclasses, but do not change it in any way that would affect the client code. This can be achieved through proper inheritance and polymorphism, as well as by defining clear contracts for each class.

- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) - The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that a client should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use. In other words, it is better to have many small and specialized interfaces than a few large and general ones. This principle helps to reduce coupling between classes and improves the maintainability and flexibility of the code.

- A violation of the ISP can result in large, complex interfaces that are difficult to implement and maintain. For example, consider a Document class with a large set of methods, some of which may only be relevant to certain types of documents (e.g. text documents, image documents, etc.). If a client only needs to work with text documents, it will still be forced to depend on the entire Document class and all of its methods, even if it only needs a small subset of those methods.

- To ensure that the ISP is not violated, it is important to design interfaces and classes in such a way that they are small, focused, and specific to the needs of the client. This can be achieved by breaking down large interfaces into smaller, more specialized ones, and by only defining the methods that are actually needed by the client.

- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) - The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. This principle helps to reduce coupling between classes and improve the maintainability and flexibility of the code.

- A violation of the DIP can result in tightly-coupled code that is difficult to maintain and change. For example, consider a class WeatherMonitor that directly depends on a class WeatherService to retrieve weather information. If the implementation of the WeatherService class changes, the WeatherMonitor class would also have to change, even if the changes are not relevant to the WeatherMonitor.

- To ensure that the DIP is not violated, it is important to design classes and modules in such a way that they depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations. This can be achieved by defining interfaces that define the required behavior, and by implementing the concrete classes that provide the actual functionality.

- Javascript based web applications, like angular, can’t maintain secrets, everything is public. A user can view page source, network requests and their payloads, and look at browser storage, nothing is secret to the user.

- For queuing promise we can use Promise.all(), it is like Array.every().

- Settling all promise by using Promise.allSettled(), for this we don’t need catch() as when it will be resolved it will have a specific key to specify which promise has been succeed or rejected. It is like Promise.some().

- We can listen any of the first resolved promise by using Promise.any(). We can use Promise.any() if we want fastest response from any of the promise, it will return and resolved the Promise.any() immediately.

- Promise.race() will also get settled even if any of the promise gets fails as-well. So, we need both .then() and .catch() block functions to make it work properly.

- Async-await is a syntactic sugar for promises to make thing easier to read or to express.

- UMD Modules – it check if it is AMD then use this format, otherwise check if Common JS then expose as CommonJS format otherwise it will export as Browser global. It doesn’t support standard ES Module as it was written before to it and ES module doesn’t work properly with this dynamic module detection approach.

- Sometimes we want to write library which supports multiple module formats, there is a standard for this called UMD (Universal Module definition). I will support AMD, common js and Global.

- The **proto** property has been deprecated to get the prototype of an object, instead of this we should use getPrototypeOf() function. Also, by using setPrototypeOf() function we can set a object with prototype inheritance with a parent object

- Dates are represented in JS in epoch manner, it stores it in milliseconds from the epoc. This epoc is in someway a arbitrary date chosen in past January 1st 1970. JavaScript tracks the number of milliseconds from that point midnight until the date we have. If we have earlier time, then it would be a negative number, after that it would be a positive number. We can get this number by calling getTime() on our date object.

- Instead of using the for loop, we should use for-in or for-of loop. It is better to use forEach also it handles sparse array value by ignoring the undefined values, however in forEach there is no support for handling the continue or break statements

- Function throttling – common scenarios for using a proxy to apply on a function to avoid being executed again and again. It can protect execution to avoid bugging down the system or prevent to hammering an API.

- A scope is called ‘lexical’ because it is linked to the to place where the function is written in the code.

- In constructor method we should only build objects and prepares them for use. Don’t construct other dependencies, talk to external resources, execute initialization logic or application logic. Don’t write any logic in constructor. Just use assignments. We should inject dependencies assign to the private variables inside constructor.

- Actually, legacy code is the one which doesn’t have automated test for it. It makes the code more brittle and harder to maintain and extend.

- ![TDD History](./images/unit-testing-tdd-history.png)

- Types of testing - unit testing, integration testing, acceptance testing (user interface).

- Immutability – an object can’t change its state. Anytime a method would change the state of the object like pushing an item on a stack, it needs to return a new copy of the object with the change. The previous instant remains unchanged. It helps us in writing concurrent code more easily

- Test doubles - it is a generic term for any kind of pretend object used in place of a real object for testing purpose.

- Fake – building on a stub and adding a bit more sophistication is the idea of fake. It contains a bit more complex implementation by having state but not functional implementation. Like below we actually add and delete the list.

![unit-testing-fake](./images/unit-testing-fake.png)

- Spy – it records the information about the interaction that it has with the SUT. This information can be available for assertion purpose by the test itself.

![unit-testing-spy](./images/unit-testing-spy.png)

- Mock – can be used to simulate complex behavior. We should not develop mock our self, we should use mock libraries which allows us to configure mock behavior. Libraries example – type mock, rhino mock and MOQ.

- Test doubles – dummies like a placeholder, stubs objects that return predefined data, fakes slightly more realistic, mocks objects pre-programmed with expected outputs for given inputs and also able to verify their calls, spies real object and verify interactions like mocks it is an hybrid of stubs, fakes and mocks.

- Unit tests are less brittle that’s why they are preferred a lot. It tests smallest behaviour.

- What is pragmatism? A reasonable and logical way of doing thing. that is based on dealing with specific situations instead of ideas and theories.

- Testing structure types - AAA (Act, Arrange, assert), Behavioral (Given, When, Then)

- Anti-patterns – we should test the overall behavior details instead of implementation details. So, don’t overuse of mock, prefer stub. Focus of return of the function instead of inner details. Tests should be short and to the point.

- Static method should be used only for pure functions like those methods which returns same value for same input, and in future there would be not change needed for those method implementations like math library inbuilt function.

- When adding code to a fixture setup or teardown is that only code that is 100 percent common to all methods should go over there. If a lot not all methods have some common code then use helper method.

- In unit testing don’t use random number to generate random number to test some value, it can generate random failures. So, we should not have random logic.

- Naming convention of the test method – choose any naming convention for unit tests that works for you and only try to stick with it consistently throughout the project.
- Instead of using the manual mock we should use automatic mock like MOQ library.

- We should avoid loops and branching instruction in tests, they may lead to bugs in testing code. It also reduces the cyclomatic complexity.

- Precondition and post-conditions of a method pattern, like passing an empty array to an method. In this case the caller function should check the param input before calling to the function, in preconditions a Boolean condition which must be satisfied before a method is invoked, in post-condition a Boolean condition which must be satisfied after a method completes

  - Method pre-condition - condition which must be satisfied before method is invoked.
  - Method post-condition - condition which must be satisfied by the invoked method after it executes.

- If a method does not want to accept null parameter then it should not throw an exception as it would be meaningless to the caller function.

- We should handle exceptions like below -

![handling-of-exceptions](./images/unit-testing-how-to-handle-exceptions.png)

- Styles of unit testing – output verification or functional verification, state verification, collaboration verification.

- Writing the test is easier then running the application. Testing is not like frosting on the cake, but it is sugar or flour which needs to bake when we are preparing the cake not in the end. This is also same issue with automation testing.

- We should break into code into two type of classes, one which have business logic and others which make stuffs. Don’t combine both classes.

- Benefits of unit testing – higher quality, fewer defects, living documentation, well-crafted code, automatic regression harness. A unit test confirms functionality of a small unit of functionality or component in a larger system.

- Code refactoring should not change the functionality of the application, in the same way the unit test case should not be fail. Refactoring is like cleaning the kitchen after serving food to customer. It improves readability, maintainability and scalability of code. We should refactor the code after fixing a failing test, before adding a new feature or after identifying a quality problem. Simple refactoring – rename, introduce parameter, extract method.

- Isolating code - Dummy, stubs, Fake, Spy, Mock

- Dummy – it is the simplest and most primitive type of test double and will contain no implementation.

  ```typescript
  var person = new Person();
  person.first = 'John';
  person.last = 'Snow';
  Assert.IsNotNull(person.fullName);
  ```

- Stubs – it is a minimal implementation of a class that likely implements a given interface or some abstract base class. It doesn’t maintain state and leaves method unimplemented like it just return some hard-code value directly:

  ```typescript
  public class StubRepo: IOwnerRepository
  {
  public IOwner FindById(int id){}
  public IOwner save(IOwner owner)
  {
  return new Owner();
  }
  public void Delete(IOwner owner){}
  }
  ```

- We can have separate build environment for acceptance test running and can trigger once a day. We can also share it reports to business for progress:

![unit-testing-acceptance-testing-progress-report](./images/unit-testing-acceptance-testing-progress-report.png)

- Prudent code coverage – 100% code coverage doesn’t mean no defects. Use code coverage as a developer tool not a performance metric. Let the code coverage find things that are important enough to add test, but realize that it is only contextually important and it is very rare that we need to strive for any sort of code coverage numbers up around 90 and 100%.

- Devi’s advocate, Gollum style and Ping Pong technique to write unit test case:

![unit-testing-devils-advocate](./images/unit-testing-devils-advocate.png)

![unit-testing-ping-pong](./images/unit-testing-ping-pong.png)

- While creating an interface it should either contains all properties or all functions not both.

- It is not creation of millions of objects that keep application from being efficient but it is rather the efficiency of methods that we are executing that may make it slow. So, we can create many objects using immutable objects without causing any performance issue.

- We should only throw exception if there is no way for the application to continue working under circumstances, otherwise implement different use case as-well. Also, don’t handle the exception in immediate caller but at the top most caller, the one which initiated the whole operation, by this the lower parts of the code will be clean from complicated error handling code, they will focus on normal control flow. We can handle this by showing a pop-up to user, retry the function or simply ignoring the error and moving forward. While using the immutable objects try to keep them small.

- While designing a class it should contains operations which naturally belongs to the class, if operation doesn’t belong to a class the move it out to a dependency and use the dependency to complete the operation.

- Marble testing is a technique where we draw marble diagrams using ACSII characters while writing unit test to visualize asynchronous observables behavior in a synchronous way. Benefits of marble testing – readable code, test synchronously and helps to find out race condition in our code. Marble syntax - -, |, #, ^, !, a, ()

- For empty observable use `|`, for never use `_` or `----`.

- Hot observables start emitting the values before any subscribe method is called on. Any subscribers can subscribe at any time and they can get the latest values at the time of subscription. They are multicast means more than one subscriber can subscribe to this observable however they will listen to the same producer. Publish and share are used to make a hot observable like tune radio channel, cinema theater, mouse clicks, live movies, live cricket match, stock tickers, live life events.

![unit-testing-jasmine-marble-hot-observable](./images/unit-testing-jasmine-marble-hot-observable.png)

- Cold Observable – In RxJs the observables are cold by nature. Cold is when the producer is owned by the observable. Observable creates and activates the producer at the time of subscription only. The data is created from the observable itself. Will produce data only when subscribe method has been called. Subscriber get their own copy of values and they are unicast i.e. one subscriber per producer like of, from, interval, timers. Real life example – watching downloaded movies, recorded podcast or song, snapshot movies in which each have their own copy.

![unit-testing-jasmine-marble-cold-observable1](./images/unit-testing-jasmine-marble-cold-observable1.png)
![unit-testing-jasmine-marble-cold-observable2](./images/unit-testing-jasmine-marble-cold-observable2.png)

- Frame – Jasmine-marbles converts observable sequence into frames. Frame is a JSON that consists of RxJs notification object that wraps the actual delivered value with additional metadata and message type.

![unit-testing-jasmine-marble-frame](./images/unit-testing-jasmine-marble-frame.png)

- RxJS schedulers are centre to control the time for any operator or observables in our project. Also, RxJS has made this schedulers injectable so that we can mock these schedulers and control the time in our test cases.

- Scheduler is a primitive inside RxJS, RxJS operators take scheduler as the second optional parameter. It is async by default. Marble testing uses virtual time so that we can test these async function synchronously.

- Race condition scenario – in a scenario where we are searching a string, and first search return the value with a delay than second one, then in the result we will get the first result as a final response by overriding the second one. To avoid this we can use the switchMap operator, it will cancel the previous Http request in-case of second has been triggered and always return the latest result.

- In integration test we test component and its template together. In integration if we only test parent component then it becomes shallow integration test otherwise if we also test its working with its child or directive component then it becomes deep integration test.

- To write the integration test to test the template along with component, we need to use the ‘Testbed’.

- A component fixture is a wrapper for component that also has few extra properties for testing, we can use its one of the properties called componentInstance to get the instance of the component itself.

- Use fixture.detectChanges() on component spec files to tell the component to run change detection and update any binding that may exist on the component. It will also cause to ngOnInit() lifecycle to run.

- The flush() method lets us decide what data to send back when the call is made.

- Content Security Policies (CSP) Reporting - It is regarding the policies send alongside with website says where can this page load images, scripts and styles from, and where the form can post the requests and the browser will restrict the page accordingly. We can send it either in http header or meta-tags. We can also mention the report-uri where those reports will be sent. It was originally design to stop cross side scripting.

```typescript
Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests
Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: default-src https:;report-uri https://demo.report-uri.com/r/default/csp/reportOnly
```

- Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) Reporting - CAA is much safer than HPKP, by which we can say whom we want to authorize some particular CAs to be able to issue certificates for us.

- Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Reporting - Now, the browser has built-in an XSS auditor, in XSS attack we generally have kind of get parameter they sent to the server, rendered into the DOM and then reflected back to the browser.

```typescript
x-xss-protection: 1; report=https://report.uri.com/xss/enforce
```

- Cross-site scripting (XSS) – latest frameworks are helping to prevent this vulnerability.

- Broken Authentication – passwords are very vulnerable and very in-secure. We can refer `haveibeenpwned.com` and avoid user to choose the password which were breached in history. The password rotation was never a good policy and it works against us as humans are terrible at passwords.

- Sensitive data exposure – SSN, credit cards information, addresses, religion, health records, political affiliation, birthday. Combination of these information can become dangerous.

- XML external entities (XXE) – SAST static source code analysis (manual code reviews), we can also use DAST tool for testing.

- Broken access control – IDOR, indirect object references, where we can twiddle a value in the URL to get someone else’s data. We should test access control so that we can’t do things outside of our privilege level.

- Security Misconfiguration – weak ciphers, SSL problems, we can use tools to check them.

- Insecure deserialization – remote command execution (RCA) running command on other server, and another thing is changing the serialized objects to elevate our privileges to do something interested, tempering of objects. To avoid this, we can use HMAC and check the validity of object type on server to check its integrity.

- Using components with knows vulnerabilities – we should break our build if any vulnerable component is found. Latest package manager automatically detects such problem with 3rd party libraries and CICD we should break the build. We can use CSP to avoid such issues.

- Insufficient logging and monitoring – we should have some sort of audit trails in place.

- HSTS helps us ensure that connections are always made securely and they never drop back to HTTP.

- What Is Serialization and Deserialization? - When we want to store an object to disk then we need to represent the multi-dimensional object into a flattened format. So, serialization is converting an object into a byte stream. A byte stream can be a file or a data stream over a network.

- Insecure deserialization – (serialized) data abusing the security of an application when being deserialized. Abuse of logic, corrupt data, denial of service, remote code execution. It is possible to execute arbitrary code merely by deserializing a corrupted or untrusted file. It affects confidentiality, integrity and availability.

- We should not use equal sign to compare the two strings as it is not cryptographically secure, as it will lead to timing attach, so always use built-in functions to compare hashes with each other.

- The dangers of logging too much – legislation, confidentiality (credentials, payment details, sensitive information), information overload, cost of processing information. Information exposure through and error message – the dangers of showing users, or non-privileged accounts error messages.

- Certificate authorities – it is an entity that issues digital certificates. Our machine needs to trust a CA. The CA signs the certificate; and when it is returned to the browser from the website, our machine validates that the certificate is legitimate by referring to our local list of trusted authorities. To check this list use certmgr.msc from run command, this list is used by windows, ie and chrome.

- SSL vs. TLS – we should ideally use term TSL not SSL as SSL is dead already:

- HTTP strict transport security (HSTS) – now redirect will give 307 status instead of 301, also the size would be 0. The browser will perform 307 internal redirect. Once our browser sees the STS response header, for the period of time, specified in that max age value, it will not make an insecure request to that domain.

```typescript
strict-transport-security: max-age=2592000
```

```typescript
Status Code: 307 Internal Redirect
Non-Authoritative-Reason: HSTS
```

- Using HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) – it will tell the browser you may not make an insecure request. Internally within the browser, you need to redirect or effectively go and make that request securely. That’s it also took only fraction of millisecond for first request with 307 status code, so by this the man in the middle won’t see this first request but the second request only.

```typescript
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains; preload
```

- Secure cookies – capturing someone cookie will lead to session hijacking. Secure cookie will not get send over insecure connection. So, always use secure cookies flag as default setting:

![secure cookie settings](./images/security-secure-cookie-settings.png)

- Using HTTPS will reduce the load on client and server both sides. As HTTP uses 1.1 protocol but HTTPS uses h2 protocol i.e. HTTP2, and HTTP2 allows for a binary stream of content, so lots of data coming down to the parallel. HTTP2 is only supported over TLS.

- Getting new certificate and renewing it has very less cost involved. We can use letsencrypt.org for free certificate authority. We can use `cerbot.eff.org` for automatically renewal of the certificates.

- To avoid enumeration risk, show below message when login failed, like a generic message, don’t say that user doesn’t exist:

![security-avoid-enumeration-risk](./images/security-avoid-enumeration-risk.png)

- Even in below case, if user type unavailable password then don’t show that it doesn’t exist, as we don’t want to show presence of a user on our system:

![security-avoid-enumeration-risk2](./images/security-avoid-enumeration-risk2.png)

- To solve an issue where account is already exist, sent an email to their registered email, so do not show message like "Username already taken".

- Brute force attack is to guess someone else password again and again, hackers use botnet for this which provides thousands of different IP addresses, so we cannot verify the request per address. If someone try to do failed login with many attempts, we can simply lock his account or can have a buffer for some minutes to let them retry. Or use OAuth with google or Facebook to delegate this problem to them.

- Brute force attacks – an attacker trying over and over again to execute some sort of online process like trying to login into someone account with different password.

- In password strength do not put maximum limit threshold, as user want to use pass phrase.

- With anti-automation aka Captcha is bad for user experience, it is used to avoid bot to create spam registrations. Using Captcha on registration/sign-up is okay as it will be one-time activity for a user, but we should not use it on login.

- Using CAPTCHA for anti-automation – suppose someone made a automation tool and in make thousands to call for sign-up then that email person will get those many emails which will lead to spamming. To avoid this, we use re-captcha.

- Protecting the logon against brute force – degrade the service means for each time failed logon take some more time for re-login and sending the response back by using thread sleep, and we can return a message that maximum retry has been exceeded, please try after sometime. So, each request will take longer time, server can track number of hits against the account.

- Multiple simultaneous logins – it depends upon business needs, like for bank website we should not allow it, but for website like stackoverflow.com we might allow it as user wants to open that website from multiple of devices. It is also not feasible on server to know whether a user is logged-in or not, as the cookie is based on client interaction.

- Broken authentication and session management – to protect the cookie from session hijacking, we can secure it by setting it as HTTP only by this cookie cannot be read by client script to avoid XHR attach to read that cookie, if we also set the secure flag to true then it can only be sent over HTTPS connection.

- X-Frame-Options – if we use deny value then it means this page cannot be framed, means cannot be put inside iframe of any other page. This helps in prevent click checking.

```typescript
X-Frame-Options: Deny
```

- The frame-ancestors – to avoid click jacking attacks. Attacker would embed the targeting website in his website into an iframe, then making that target website transparent putting content the attacker provides under the target website and enticing the user to click what they think is a button the attacker’s website but instead clicking a button on the target website. We can avoid this by this header so that our websites won’t be framed into some other website.

```typescript
frame-ancestors: 'none';
```

- Security threats on server side - SQL injection, insufficient authorization, weak credential storage

- Security threats on client side - Cross site scripting, insufficient transport layer security, click jacking.

- Non-standard and browser prefixed headers – headers started with X was browser specific and has been deprecated now – X-Content-Security-Policy, X-WebKit-CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection.

- HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) - This is progression over HSTS, which tells the website must also serve a particular certificate that the browser expects, not just on that’s valid but one that adheres to a very specific set of criteria, to avoid a scenario where certificate authority itself gets compromised.

```typescript
Public-Key-Pins: pin-sha256=[pin 1]; pin-sha256=[pin 2]; max-age=2592000; report-uri=[uri];includeSubdomains
```

- Cross site request forgery – changing the password or account details using context of hacker. Use anti-forgery token to avoid this.

- Encryption is also not secure, because as soon as the encrypted key is found, entire system can be decrypted back. Instead of this we should use cryptography using hash so that no one can decrypt them back.

- We need to use hashing with a salt to avoid getting same output with same input, it also protects with rainbow table problems, but we need to use hash algorithm properly:

![security-hash-with-salt](./images/security-hash-with-salt.png)

- Email as username vs. free text for username for uniqueness – we should prefer email as username. Email as username is easier to remember, one less field to capture at sign-up, it is already unique per user, must be able to change in future. Free text for username can be displayed to user with less privacy risk, enable multiple accounts against one email, requires a "retrieve my username feature".

- Password strength criteria – don’t limit the max entry criteria, also don’t put any condition for not having special characters, don’t discriminate with some character, allow user to pass any character. Pass phrases are stronger. We can use utility like 1password to generate password and saving it into centralize place.

- We can also make backend call to check whether password is very simple to crack, then show as invalid like below, we can check it with bad list of passwords.

- Don’t disable the password paste option on the field. People disable it to avoid brute force attack, but disabling the paste option, make the other worst problems like bad UX. To solve a problem, if that solution makes the problem worse than it is called as cobra effect.

- Verifying accounts via Email to avoid entering fake and corrupted emails, as user can use any random or someone else email’s id.

- Don’t lock an account out as it will lead to DoS (denial of service) attack. We should degrade the service and log everything. Don't lock an account out, restrict logon by IP and limit attempts with a cookie.

- Remember Me - This feature frequently implemented insecurely, by using user name and password in cookie and using it for re-login. It is a feature which requires trade-offs: security versus usability. It can disclose the credential of a user. It reduces the fiction of return visits for frequently used services like stackoverflow.com. It allows long-running sessions. But it increases numerous risks – someone else using the PC, a CSRF risk being exploited, if someone has access to unlocked machine. To make available this feature, it depends upon the nature of the application. We can give this option just for remembering the Client ID not password for sensitive websites, but this is not a remember me feature completely as it won’t do the auto login when user comes back to the website

- If we have expiry as ‘session’, then if we close the browser and reopen it, we won’t be able to logged on, the cookie will go away. If we use remember me feature, then it will have one more cookie for expiry of 1 year, it will not go away and reauthenticate the user again automatically. To implement it securely, don’t create remember me cookie, just change the auth token cookie from session scope to sometime duration scope like for a week, also mark http and secure flag as true. Additional security controls – like ebay we can choose an approach where we are breaking the cookie into two parts, first for user identity for long expiration time, and another cookie which requires for financial activity for short duration and re-authenticate user for the financial activity only.

- How attackers change account details – direct browser access, credential theft, CSRF, session hijacking (sending session on HTTP connection on in query strings), social engineering.

- Account attributes attackers want to change – password, email, identity, credit card, attackers can chain together these many information and processes in order to gain access to a victim’s account.

- To change the password or email, we should also ask the current password as-well, also keep change password feature on its own page

- Account change notification – to cater a scenario where attacker already got the access for legitimate password, we need to notify the changes on different channel as-well like email or SMS. We should not allow to change the email address without first confirming via the original email address on the account. But if user not have access to original email then it will be a problem, then we can solve this by directing to manual human interaction at support desk.

- The risk of password hints – don’t use password hint in any circumstances.

- Why logging off is important – due to remember me we can have a long running session – also in browser if we choose below feature, then browser won’t delete the cookie after browser gets closed browser even if we don’t use remember me feature, so to avoid this we need to provide explicitly logoff functionality.

- What constitutes of logging off – it removes the authentication token, by setting remember me token as empty and setting cookie expiry one day ago already.

- Web application firewalls (WAF) – we can get it by using Cloudflare service, it will look request pattern and reject it if it found malicious before allowing it to hit the actual web server:

![security-web-application-firewalls](./images/security-web-application-firewalls.png)

- We humans are the weakest link in the security chain.

- In symmetric cryptography same key is used to decrypt and encrypt the message, but asymmetric cryptography uses different keys to avoid man in the middle attack

- Types of cryptograph algorithms – symmetric, asymmetric and hash functions.

- Asymmetric algorithms – public and private keys, the RSA algorithm.

- Big O notation allows us to express in terms of the size of the input, the amount of work takes to solve the problem -

![security-big-o-notation-types](./images/security-big-o-notation-types.png)

- Public key can identify somebody, and their private key can prove their identity.

- OpenID Connect – it allows users to log in to 3rd party sites using their Facebook or twitter or google credentials. It is built on top of OAuth.

- The role of OpenID Connect and OAuth – OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner. OpenID is for authentication and OAuth is for Authorization

- OAuth2 is about requesting access tokens from an authorization serve, then we can use this token to talk with backend service. OAuth is an open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications. OAuth is about delegating authorization; means we want to authorize a client to access our resources on our behalf.

![security-oauth-architecture](./images/security-oauth-architecture.png)

- OpenID connect means the application doesn’t need to connect with back-end service, but it needs to know who the user is. It is for authentication.

- OpenID Connect - It is built on top of OAuth2, and sometime we just need authentication at least to begin with to identify user in an application. OAuth2 is regularly abused for that.

- OpenID connects adds some new concepts like ID token and UserInfo endpoint. OpenID code flow – identity provider, authorization endpoint, token endpoint, user info endpoint.

- OAuth2 Concerns - Specification bloat, bearer tokens, security theatre, attack surface.

- Evolution of software ecosystem -

![security-evolution-of-software-ecosystem](./images/security-evolution-of-software-ecosystem.png)

- Types of versioning – calendar based, sequence based and semantic based versioning. Recommended is semantic based versioning.

- Common sources of untrusted data – in the URL via a query string or route, posted via a form, in cookies, in the request headers, external services, our own database.

- We should sanitize the data right after receiving from the user. So, if user trying to search like `<i>enzo</i>` then the text should display on the screen in encoding form of it i.e.`&lt;i&gt;enzo&lt;/i&gt;`

- We should trim down all the header from HTTP response which might disclose the framework or the server underline technologies details. We can also change the header properties sort order and default bad request or default response format which was specific to some server format to avoid attacker guessing the server details.

- HTTP fingerprinting of servers – it is to identifying various attributes of a particular website which might lead it to disclose what is running underneath.

- Fuzz testing – it is the process for searching for vulnerabilities does commonly adhere to a very regular pattern like in XSS to avoid laborious manual testing, and we bombarding an application with random data with those patterns. We can use third party tool like intruder21 or fuzzdb for doing fuzz testing.

- Mounting a click jacking attack – in this the attacker will also get the access of anti-forgery token by rendering the website into iframe and setting as opacity to 0, and below to that page will render the corrupted website. In below the I “Wanna win!” button is overlay on “Change Password” button

- We should store password using hashed approach while saving the database. If we store it into plain text then there is cryptography, everything is immediately exposed if the password storage is breached. If we use encrypted approach, then it can also get decrypted which makes is less secure. Only if we use hashed approach, it would become one-way, deterministic algorithm which means that password can't be un-hashed.

- We should re-authenticate the user before key actions, like asking current password on change password screen.

- Unlike browser, mobile app doesn’t have secure paddle lock icon, as mobile app doesn’t run in browser. The mobile app, company itself handle the client communication, so we should not always trust the mobile apps.

- We can have two types of certificates DV and AV. Below is an AV certificate, it requires a business name also need to be registered.

![security-padlock](./images/security-padlock.png)

- We can connect fiddler for the remote machine-like android device from our computer. By this we can intercept mobile app data in fiddler. By we can get a sense for how device is communicating with backend servers.

- Instead of using the .png format we should use .jpeg format as it has better compression and can reduce the data size 75%.

- By using Wi-Fi Pineapple and LAN Tap, we can monitor the traffic even for those devices which makes hard to proxy traffic like IOT devices.

- Discovering leaky API’s – we should not return sensitive data from the web API in normal text form, also don’t return the data which is not need or non-essentials data on client side

- Configuring fiddler to decrypt encrypted connections – it will install its root certificate on our windows machine, by this we just compromised our system (PC) only.

- LDAP kept our user directory together, assign roles and query information about the user.

- The idea of OAuth2 is how we can create valet parking key, not the master key. By which a resource owner gives the client a key to access the resources on the resource’s behalf, without giving the client master key aka the password.

- Security tokens are protected data structures, contain information about issuer and subject, signed and typically contain an expiration time. A client requests a token, an issuer issues a token and a resource like API consumes a token, that resource has a trust relationship with the issuer.

- History of token - SAML (XML based, very expression, many encryption & signature options), Simple Web Token (SWT), JSON web tokens (JWT).

- JWT structure and format - headers (metadata, algorithms & keys used), claims (issuer, audience, issue at, expiration, subject, other application defined claims)

![security-jwt-token-format](./images/security-jwt-token-format.png)

- There are two type of tokens access tokens (short lived) and refresh token (long lived).

- History of accessibility

![accessibility-history](./images/accessibility-history.png)

- Who needs accessibility –

![accessibility-who-needs-it.png](./images/accessibility-who-needs-it.png)

- Create accessible forms – each control should have label or aria-labelled-by, use grouping of controls, provide clear notifications, break up long forms. We should avoid placeholder text in your forms. It is often low contrast and difficult to see.

- Assistive technology – screen readers, screen magnification software, speech input software, head pointers, eye tracking, single switch entry devices.

- Web accessibility guidelines – WCAG (A, AA, AAA).

- 4 types of disability – physical, vision-related, cognitive and hearing-related.

- Focusable elements – links, buttons, form elements – text input, text area, select, checkboxes, radio buttons.

- On the website load, the first tab should go to the ‘skip link’, it generally skips the site navigation or repetitive contents.

- In radio button, if a radio is selected then we need to use the arrows to move around other options, but if none is selected then we can use tab key to move around other options. It is called widget navigation where too many focusable elements on a control, it provides skip links functionality.

- Interactive form controls are activated with SPACE key. For links to activate use enter key.

- For low vision user, the content should be zoomable, it should not lead to any loss of functionality and content.

- Too much use of the animation can cause distractions among users, the website should also provide pause, stop and hide the animation. We can use chrome emulation for testing

- We should have language, charset=utf-8, title tags on the HTML page. The title bar of browser should also include company name.

- HTML landmarks such as header, nav, main, footer, aside, form and section should have accessible name by providing aria-label attribute.

- Links are for navigation or change of context, buttons are for action.

- The email field should have autocomplete attribute as `email`.

- The WCAG (web content accessibility guidelines) measure to accessibility of a website. Level A, Level AA, Level AAA. Who benefits – who only has one arm so can’t operate mouse, only the keyboard, a person who is blind so uses a screen reader, a person who has dexterity problem, can’t click on a small item, uses keyboard if she is struggling with the mouse.

- Basic commands on form which can be interacted with like button, link and input controls, they are called focusable elements, pressing enter on that link or button should activate it. Space bar is used to toggle a checkbox and open a select control. Up and down arrows are used to scrolling the page or scroll through select component.

- Mouse should be required only for drawing in an art program, some games, but drag and drop and resizing and rotating can be handled through the keyboard.

- If we set tab index as -1 then we cannot tab to it with keyboard, but can set focus programmatically. If we set 0 then we can tab to element and focus order determined by the HTML.

- ARIA is a technical specification for improving the accessibility of web pages, it allows us to update the accessibility tree.

- Common navigation patterns are navigation bars, sidenavs, breadcrumb and hamburger menus.

- It will be hard and require more money to support accessibility if we try to implement it after project has been complete, if we start the project with accessibility in mind then it will become easy and without any additional budget.

- Typography – choosing right typeface and hierarchy of font sizes it should be in rage of 16px to 20px.

- Every transition or animation should have purpose. When everything is just flashing and sliding around all over the page, it is not good for anyone, it makes user sick. We should provide an option to the user to disable animations.
- Images are inaccessible so we need to use alt attribute to provide description of content of the image.
- Aria roles is about filing the gap between what is available and the semantics of the code that we are using and what’s actually occurring in our rich internet applications.

- ARIA states – describe dynamic states and changed with JavaScript: aria-busy, aria-disabled, aria-grabbed, aria-hidden, aria-invalid.

- For forms the spacebar should activates controls and the enter key should submit the default action of the form.

- We should only use custom elements, widgets and ARIA when we either do not have an HTML equivalent control or when we absolutely cannot use the existing control because it doesn’t have the functionality that we need.

- Software has to work and be easy and enjoyable to work. User can easily and quickly accomplish their tasks.

- Wireframe types - Low-fidelity, High-fidelity.

- Principles - Alignment, Contrast, Visual hierarchy, Proximity, Layouts, Whitespace, Consistency.

- UX Testability

  - Visibility of System Status - the system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. Like showing username on login, showing copy/delete progress windows OS.
  - Match between system and the real world - the system should speak the user's language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to user. Like not using words like `Accept/Decline` but `Save password/Nope`.
  - Error prevention - like showing auto-complete, showing confirm dialog before deleting the record.
  - Recognition rather than recall - showing dropdown, intellisense

- The good user experience has 3 desired results – happy, satisfied and productive. Our ultimate results should be delighted, contented, and empowered.

- Avoid common pitfalls - throwing data on the screen, exposing tech to the user, forcing the user to think like DBA, Messy UI, coding for expert user.

- Low friction clicks are okay, vertical scrolling is okay.

- Leading hack - making the user brain work less by leading them to their goal. Showing steps (wizard) on the screen.

- Limit the number of colors used should be 5 or less.

- Reading in upper case takes 10% more time than lower case, so avoid using them.

- A UX developer can bring efficiency, logic, relevance, user advocacy, research, communication, effectiveness, interaction, elegance, simplicity.

- Types of industry - Finance, Education, Retail, Healthcare, Business & IT Services, Research & Development, Government and Defense.

- In natural world there is no monochrome except blue sky overhead on a clear day, even sky is a gradient. So, while creating UI component use gradient from light to dark as top down lighting bias to makes the screen appear as more natural not as artificial monochrome. And the gradient shouldn’t be noticeable and flashy

- Instead of rectangle design, we should use curves. Humans usually prefer curved things over sharp-edged things – curved connotes safety, sharp-edged connotes danger. Curve soften the design and less stressful.

- We should bring the UI element on screen on more gradual way and move that from one place to another in gradual way too or changing the size. Using animation as it feels more natural and don’t surprise or confuse user. While changing the screen from one to another also try to implement a subtle animation. Animation also help in maintaining context.

- When an action is not appropriate, prevent the user from doing it, provide a visual signal that the action is not available, like disabling a button instead of allowing it to click and showing error message or any popup.

- Sliders component are good for numbers with large increments of numbers where the user is not quite so interested in precision.

- Reserve confirmation for very exceptional circumstances, otherwise it will dilute its value like in windows vista. Instead of this we can provide some undo like functionality or show a countdown before making the commit to the database, this is called forgiveness

- Try to avoid the horizontal arrangement of radio buttons. Horizontal radio buttons can be difficult to scan — it can be challenging for users to tell which label the radio button corresponds to.

- Toggle switch control is easier for the thumb. This property makes it suitable for mobile devices.

- Dropdowns should be the last resort. Whenever possible, instead of dropdown, try to use alternative controls that help the user to complete the task but have better usability.

- Interaction Design (IxD) – the process of designing interactive products, focusing on how users will interact with them. sometimes called “conversations design”. Interaction design dimensions – words, visual representations, physical objects or space, time, behavior.

- Fast, cross platform, intellisense and auto complete, debugging, rich refactoring, sits perfectly between editor and IDE.

- What is Editor - lightweight/fast, file/folders, many languages, many workflows, keyboard centered

- What is IDE - project systems, code understanding, debug, integrated build, file->new, wizards, designers, ALM integration, platform tools

- Electron is a native shell for widows, mac, and Linux that hosts JavaScript-based app like Monaco. Visual studio code is a combination of Monaco and Electron.

- Installing extension locally – copy your extension to the VS code extension directory. (windows - `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`)

- We should use arrows one way and two accordingly and shapes doesn’t represent any meaning, we just need to be consistent in shapes.

- We should have a key section to define the meaning of different attributes used in the diagrams

- We describe the following levels and diagram names:

  - Level 0 — Business Capabilities Diagram: The key audience is business executives and non-technical stakeholders.
  - Level 1 — Technology Capabilities Diagram: The key audience is CIOs, CTOs, CISOs and Strategy & Planning managers.
  - Level 2 — Architecture Diagram: The key audience is Designers and Project Managers.
  - Level 3 — Design Diagram: The key audience is coders, testers and architects.

- Five architecture diagrams types

  - Application Architecture Diagram
  - Integration Architecture Diagram
  - Deployment Architecture Diagram
  - DevOps Architecture Diagram
  - Data Architecture Diagram

- The Flow Diagram - This diagram illustrates the moving parts in a business process.

![architectural-flow-diagram](./images/architectural-flow-diagram.png)

- The Persona Diagram - It is important to show that your architecture solves the business problem. A persona diagram describes a chronological view and actors in a particular workflow. This is your best tool for proving that you’ve taken the business into consideration when developing your solution.

![architectural-personal-diagram](./images/architectural-personal-diagram.png)

- The Infrastructure Diagram - The purpose of this diagram is to show what has been built and how the system currently works. Consider this a blueprint of the application you built.

![architectural-infrastructural-diagram](./images/architectural-infrastructural-diagram.png)

![architectural-infrastructural-diagram2](./images/architectural-infrastructural-diagram2.png)

![architectural-technology-diagram](./images/architectural-technology-diagram.png)

![architectural-application-diagram](./images/architectural-application-diagram.png)

- Software Architect - Make high-level design decisions and document them, Mentor more junior engineers, Do code reviews, Develop the most critical part of the codebase, Refactoring to get rid of technical debt, Drink coffee.

- Types of architecture - classic three-layer database-centric, domain centric, application layer, CQRS.

- Software architect role - how to design software and works, functional architecture,

- Technical architect role - microservices, how pieces are connected with each other, design how software hangs together, cloud aws learning

- Code review serves as an exchange of best practices and experiences. Code reviews should be classless, it should provide an opportunity for mentorship and collaboration. Means a junior can also review the pull request raised by senior member.

- The PR should be small, it can contains changed lines from 100 to 500 and 5 to 10 files changed.

- We should have a self-review, before submitting the pull request. Also, We should reply to all comments, whether we fixed them as suggested, or fixed the way we preferred or push back the comment.

- We should have at least 2 code reviewers and one of them should know the business logic behind the code and customer requirement.

- Praise the author in the comment if work exceeds expectations, new team member picks up quickly, high quality code, reinforces good practices.

- If we found a nitpick and still want to approve it then we can comment like “nitpick: several types in comments. Approving anyway”. We should not be doing pre-approving frivolously.

- Git was developed by Linus Torvalds for managing the Linux kernel. It can be used offline and online for doing all the related operations. We can push or pull our changes after connecting with the network. Git is actually a bunch of individual scripts, most of which are written in Perl.

- Other source code control system works with files, but Git works with content. When we say add to a file, it takes a snapshot of that, adds that to the index and then that’s what gets committed. We can fake this file based thing by saying Git commit –a, this commands stage any changes that are in the whole project right now, add those and do commits.

- The Git commands are called porcelain commands. At core Git is simply a map (a table with keys and values), a simple structure that maps keys to values. This structure is persistent and stored on our disk. Values are content of file, when we give values Git will calculate a key for us i.e. a SHA1 hash.

- Git Branches - Another layer will make it a revision control system which includes features like branches and merges. When we do our first commit, Git creates a default branch the name is master branch. Git save its details in heads folder in refs folder of .git folder, it is the SHA1 of the last commit, the branch is nothing else but a simple reference to a commit. Branches are just references to the commit.

- Detached Head – it is a situation when we checkout a commit. Then the head will refer to that commit, not the current branch. Git also runs a garbage collection like in below scenario, if we wanted to avoid that then we must create a branch which will refer to these isolated commits.

- By using tags, we can tag a commit with a tag name. The command can be git tag –a dinner. The tag information saved into tags folder inside ref folder. Tag is also just a reference to an object just like branch but it doesn’t move. On a new commit, the current branch will move not the tag.

- Git Fork – it is kind of like clone, but it is a remote clone. By this we are cloning the project from someone else account to our GitHub account, and then we clone it from out account to our local machine. Upstream – to track the changes to the original project, then we need to add another remote point at it. It is called upstream. We can pull and push the changes to our account project, but only do pull from the upstream original account. We can send a pull request to this original account maintainer to pull our changes.

- Git is a source control system used by GitHub. GitHub is a Git Repository for open source. Along with Bitbucket they provide a great user experience for Git users in the cloud. Git uses snapshots instead of deltas like other source control system. Atlassian Source Tree is a famous GUI toll for Git.

- Stashing – it means if things go messy, save changes for later and then apply when needed. It is like shelve set in TFS; they will no longer be present in working area.

- Recovering deleted commits – we can recover this dangling commit, we need to get back the value of SHA1 using commands reflog, and fsck.

- Reverting commits – use command git revert #commit SHA1. Be careful while reverting the reverting a merge. Revert doesn’t mean undo operation.

- Peer to Peer Model -

![git-peer-to-peer-model](./images/git-peer-to-peer-model.png)

- Centralize Model -

![git-centralized-model](./images/git-centralized-model.png)

- Pull request model -

![git-pull-request-model](./images/git-pull-request-model.png)

- Dictator and Lieutenants model

![git-dictator-and-lieutenants-model](./images/git-dictator-and-lieutenants-model.png)

- In general, we have integration, release, feature and hotfix branches.

- Constraints – we can use Git Hooks feature to raise some notification on different Events before committing like checking if build is red on server then showing warning while doing another commit.

- Evil merge – we should never introduce changes in the merge commit.

- Disadvantages of doing all work in main branch instead of multiple feature branches - difficult to track, difficult to manage merges, difficult to back out, difficult to experiment

- Creating a Hotfix - If we spot something wrong in release production code to fix these issues are called hot fixes by creating hot fixes branch. In this we create this branch from master and then merge the code back into master and development.

- Version control system: it is a time travel machine for our project.

- Evolution of version control - Local computer -> local version control systems -> centralized version control systems -> distributed version control system

![git-short-history](./images/git-short-history.png)

![git-history](./images/git-history.png)

- Git maintained integrity using check-summed generated by SHA1 hashing algorithm.

- The three stages of a git project - working directory, staging area (index), .git Directory (repository)

- Rewriting History - Rebase – it replays a set of commits on top of a specific base commits. D*and E* are new commits but with same messages:

![git-visualizing-a-rebase](./images/git-visualizing-a-rebase.png)

- Difference between collaborators (key people) and contributors (everyone outside from the core team and have lower permissions).

  - Maintainers - key decision makers within your company who are responsible for driving a project's vision and for managing day-to-day contributions.
  - Contributors - Members within the company that help drive the software forward. Contributors are no necessarily part of the direct project team but help build software by contributing code, submitting bug fixes, and more.
  - Community members - people who use the project or software within the company.

- Creating GitHub pages – to share information, it can be a static site hosting website without server-side code.

- Label can be applied on issues and PR. Labels are used to organize and also prioritize items such as issues. Built-in labels - bug, duplicate, enchancements, help-wanted, question, wont-fix, good-first-issue, invalid.

- GitHub calls it pull request instead of merge request because it let you tell others about the changes you pushed to a branch the action they would do is pull those changes in once that merged. Repo permissions related to pull requests.

![git-repo-permissions](./images/git-repo-permissions.png)

- By using cherry pick we can copy specific commit to another branch. It creates duplicate commit in each branch and can cause confusion. Just use command git cherry-pick `<commit>` by specify the commit sha.
- Popular open source licenses – apache 2.0, bsd 2-caluse, bsd 3 clause, gnu gpl, gnu lgpl, mit (or expat license), Mozilla public license, cddl, eclipse public license version 2.0.

- License file deals with the legal side, Contribution Guidelines file deals with the technical side, Code of Conduct file deals with the ethical side.

- We can use fence block of code syntax by using 3 back ticks like ```html

- Two of the most popular of the lightweight variety are Markdown and reStructuredText.

- Use `_` for italics, `**` for bold, ` `` ` for code words. Use `_` for unordered list and `#` for numeric list.

- Artifact are the result of the build, if this process of creating artifacts doesn’t require any person to do anything for it to happen, other than make the change to source control, the you have continuous integration. If it also gets deployed automatically then I become continuous deployment as well.

![markdown-cd-ci](./images/markdown-cd-ci.png)

- For technical document writing reStructuredText is better than Markdown.

- Purpose of technical writing: Developers (Get information out of the heads of the creators), users (into the heads of users in a way they can use it).

- Writing process - plan -> research -> write -> review/edit -> launch

- Don’t be vague but be simple and user friendly. Don’t use passive sentence but use active sentences:

![markdown-writing-tips1](./images/markdown-writing-tips1.png)

- But sometimes we should use passive voice, which makes a sentence a bit soft -

![markdown-writing-tips1](./images/markdown-writing-tips2.png)

![markdown-writing-tips1](./images/markdown-writing-tips3.png)

![markdown-writing-tips1](./images/markdown-writing-tips4.png)

- Layout and Design

  - Serif fonts are considered classic, traditional, and embellished.
  - Sans is French for Without, Sans Serif fonts are considered modern, minimalist and clean.
  - Script fonts are more fluid in their stroke and they resemble handwriting particularly cursive handwriting. They are considered as handwritten, calligraphic and fancy.
  - Decorative fonts are also known as ornamental or display fonts. They should be used sparingly and for a very distinct purpose. They are fun, unique and expressive.

- Recommendation of uses -

![markdown-recommendation-of-uses](./images/markdown-recommendation-of-uses.png)

- If document is more than 10 pages then use table of contents. It will allow readers to locate information and pages quickly and easily.

- Use visuals – screenshots, icons, tables, graphs and flow charts.

- Create story stories as per below format -

![markdown-user-story-format](./images/markdown-user-story-format.png)

- Software design document (SDD) - A written description of a software product that gives a development team overall guidance to the architecture of the software project.

![markdown-software-design-document-format](./images/markdown-software-design-document-format.png)

- README Files – a file that helps users/other developers know how to do things with your software. Even we should write README file before we code.

- Release notes – documents the differences between two versions of the same software.

- Dynamic Components with ComponentFactory, also we should also avoid

```typescript
export abstract class Widget {
  abstract render(data: any): Component;
}

export class ChartWidget extends Widget {
  render(data: any): Component {
    return ChartComponent;
  }
}

export class TableWidget extends Widget {
  render(data: any): Component {
    return TableComponent;
  }
}

export class FormWidget extends Widget {
  render(data: any): Component {
    return FormComponent;
  }
}

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class WidgetFactory {
  getWidget(type: string): Widget {
    switch (type) {
      case 'chart':
        return new ChartWidget();
      case 'table':
        return new TableWidget();
      case 'form':
        return new FormWidget();
      default:
        throw new Error('Unsupported widget type');
    }
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-widget-renderer',
  template: `
    <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="widgetComponent"></ng-container>
  `,
})
export class WidgetRendererComponent {
  @Input() widget!: { type: string; data: any };
  widgetComponent!: Type<any>;

  constructor(private widgetFactory: WidgetFactory) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    const widget = this.widgetFactory.getWidget(this.widget.type);
    this.widgetComponent = widget.render(this.widget.data);
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-dynamic',
  standalone: true,
  template: `<ng-container #container></ng-container>`,
})
export class DynamicComponent {
  constructor(private viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef) {}

  createComponent(component: any): ComponentRef<any> {
    this.viewContainerRef.clear();
    return this.viewContainerRef.createComponent(component);
  }
}
```

- Error Handling with Global Interceptors

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class ErrorInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  intercept(
    req: HttpRequest<any>,
    next: HttpHandler
  ): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    return next.handle(req).pipe(
      catchError((error) => {
        console.error('HTTP Error:', error);
        return throwError(() => new Error('Something went wrong!'));
      })
    );
  }
}
```

- Real world Use cases of -

  - Implement APP_INITIALIZER to load configuration information. Suppose, you have to load API endpoints, application static contents like images/texts which are kept in different repo.
  - Implement APP_INITIALIZER to load authentication information. Suppose, you need to check login status before opening the application. Only if login is authorized then only aplication will be opened, other will display unauthorized error.

- We can debug the instance of the injected service in console with below code -

```typescript
import { ApplicationRef } from '@angular/core';

const appRef = inject(ApplicationRef);
const root = appRef.components[0].injector;
console.log(root);
```

- HyperText Markup Language – HTML is the language that we use to create document that we want to share across the world wide we or more appropriately across the internet. HTML was created to share research documents which includes text, data, images, and all linked together.

- We should not have plan text into HTML it should be enclosed in some element like div or span.

- The doctype declaration let the client know which standards we are following.

- To enable the proper parsing, use doctype tag on first line of the HTML page. Specify the lang attribute for main language of the page it is important for screen reader. For proper parsing and rendering use http-equiv and content attributes.

- `<head>` tag is used for metadata information which includes title, meta elements, script, style, link, base. The link specifies the related documents and base specify base address for all relative links on the page.

- Block vs. Inline – Block elements are container for elements for grouping they can contain other block elements and in-line element example – paragraph. Block level element will start from new a new line.

- Use `&nbsp;` for telling browser, do not break at this particular point. So, when we resize the browser it will not break that words in between but it show it as a whole in any line.

- We used links to linking within a document or another document. Likes can be absolute or relative. If files on the server use absolute path, or if they in our local site content folder then use relative path.

- History of HTML5 – WHATWG accounted that it will no longer work on named versions of HTML so there will be no HTML6, HTML7, but the HTML spec is now a living standard. So HTML 5 no longer exists as new features are found in living standard.

![html-history](./images/html-history.png)

- Standard Bodies for HTML – W3C, WHATWG, ECMASCRIPT

- Inbuilt APIs - Elements with API – canvas, audio, video, Forms element – meter, progress, math, data-list, New JavaScript APIs – canvas, web animations, Interaction, events and messaging APIs - battery status, clipboard API and events, cross document messaging, device and screen orientation, full screen, geo-location, media capture, notifications, touch events, vibration, Storage and files APIs – Blob URL’s File API, File Reader, IndexedDB, Local Storage, Real time communication APIs – Push API, server sent events, web sockets

- Fallbacks and Polyfills – fall back is to provide similar functionality as a native feature but maybe just with a different API. A Polyfills, on the other hand, is meant to replicate the exact same interface as well as functionality as how the native implementation would be built in the browser. For this use <www.html5please.com> website.

- Types of images

  - Vector – used for displaying simple images, and we can enlarge them without losing pixels. The image is made of a set of instructions of how to draw an image. It is rendered on fly when image is displayed.

  - Raster image – jpeg, png or gif. These are images with a set dimension where every pixel within the defined space of the image has a designated color. These are great for pictures but will lose pixels when enlarge. HTML5 canvas works upon raster images.

  - Canvas - it is just a drawing surface. We can draw shapes, apply colors and even manipulate images on the canvas. Due to rasterize nature of the canvas gives us a pixel by pixel control of that drawing surface. It uses underline grid system.

- Semantic HTML – mark-up that conveys meaning about its contents. It is mostly beneficial for the machines and also helps human too. Tags – small, footer, address. HTML mark-up is also used by search engines and screen readers and machine are not smart enough to understand the meaning of content.

- We should avoid using generic elements, inconsistent structure, presentational (CSS) mark-up into HTML. Like we should not use `<strong/>` tag just to bold a text, we should use it if we wanted to give text more important to other text. It should not use just for presentational purpose.

- Sectioning elements – elements whose intended use in to divide content up into logical sections like div, aside, article, section, figure, main, address, header, nav, footer

- To avoid CSS styles and JavaScript scripts to override our DOM subtree, The shadow DOM seeks to solve these systemic problems by creating an encapsulate spot to define our mark-up in CSS by creating a hidden and encapsulate subtree that is separate from the light DOM. Shadow DOM in native HTML like video, date, input type range tag. To see the shadow DOM, we need to enable setting `show user agent shadow DOM` in browser. Native elements already using shadow DOM.

- Shadow DOM alternatives – we have iframe but it is clunky to read, nondescriptive, excessive encapsulation, no clean API. We also have canvas but has accessibility issues, seo issues, can not easily compose, cannot extent existing elements.
  Shadow DOM encapsulates DOM subtrees and styles. Shadow DOM is like an iframe without all the baggage in a friendlier API

- Web real time communication lets us incorporate peer to peer video, audio and data communication in the browser without any plug-ins. Use cases and inspiration of WebRTC

![html-webrtc-use-cases](./images/html-webrtc-use-cases.png)

- History of web

![html-history-of-web](./images/html-history-of-web.png)

- What is WWW – is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by URL in linked by hypertext links and can be accessed via the internet. The internet has been around since the 80s and the web has been around since the 90s.

![html-history-of-html](./images/html-history-of-html.png)

- History of css

![html-history-of-css](./images/html-history-of-css.png)

CSS is the styling mechanism for the web. It is a standard of selectors, properties and attributes. As it is just a standard so it doesn’t do anything, it just tells the people of created the web browsers how to interpret the CSS language and how to style HTML with it.

- History of JavaScript

![html-history-of-javascript](./images/html-history-of-javascript.png)

- Html file naming conventions – always start with a lowercase letter, no special characters, no spaces, hyphens, underscores, or camel case can be used for file names with multiple word. Index.html is the standard name for a home page, browser looks for this name page to display as your lading or home page.

- HTML is made up of tags, tags tell the browser where an element should start and end. Tags should be lowercase, and each tag and its content is an HTML element.

- For checkbox and radio box, wrapped them into `<legend>` and `<fieldset>` tags

- Disabled field doesn’t get included into form data submit, but read-only field will be included. Generally, we use read-only if that user has filled its value in previous page and we don't allow to edit it on current page.

- ID vs Class attributes – use class attribute for styling instead of id.

![html-id-vs-class-attribute](./images/html-id-vs-class-attribute.png)

- If images are deemed as part of the content, we should add it as HTML. If its is there for presentation and style, it should be added using CSS.

- The full form of SASS is syntactically awesome stylesheets.

- SASS has two different syntax, the original SASS syntax a bit different from CSS. It essentially removes the curly braces and semicolons from CSS, and it relies on white space. Because of this we can’t take a CSS spreadsheet and change the extension and treat it as SASS. So, for exiting projects with large CSS stylesheet porting to SASS is problematic. Due to this an alternative syntax has been developed by name SCSS. SASS is built on Ruby, LESS and Stylus built on Node.

- Responsive Page - text, images, buttons size become large/small, also page layout changes based on screen size changes. We can use media queries for it
- Cookies are just additional pieces of information that the server asks the browser to store and send back to the server with every request. But now local storage is preferred. These generally stores authentication and configuration related information which server needs to see in any request. In JavaScript object we can define properties that are functions, in JSON functions are not a legal property.

- Page request lifecycle: when we request a webpage in our browser, either by clicking a link to a new page or typing a URL in the browser. The server sends down the HTML to our page in the body of the response. Now after this browser has received the HTML it begins processing it. And part of that processing is to look four kind of different directions in the HTML i.e. CSS links, scripts tags of the source attributes, image tags, and font face directives in CSS rules. New requests were made based on these and response included their assets.

- App shell architecture – cached shell loads instantly on repeat visits, it is a main u ser interface for our application without any content. by this we can avoid showing black page while loading which frustrates users.

- We will use the service worker to cache the app shell. The cache API is a cache storage for requests and responses, it is a pre-requisite for service workers. It stores values in key value pairs, and available from window scope and service worker scope. Like below it will cache the entire request and response.

- Web worker – a script running int the background. It initiated from the main document, runs separately from main document and doesn’t have access to the DOM. It is often used as a programmable network proxy which lets you control incoming and outgoing network request. We can combine it with the cache API to serve requests from the cache. Specially if network request fails from server, it can handle it

![html-service-worker-life-cycle](./images/html-service-worker-life-cycle.png)

- Web workers – it brings background threading as a first-class citizen to web browsers. We can splice an intensive process logic into a worker and it will run independent of the UI thread.

- Workbox caching strategies –

![html-workbox-cache-strategies](./images/html-workbox-cache-strategies.png)

- Browser cache, if files are already in browser cache then it will not make request to sever for them. In application, all the cache files will be in grouped to a single manifest file. We should not mix browser caching and application caching. In browser, we can specify when a file will be expired, but in application cache we can only send updated files if we change the manifest file.

- Web storage comes in two flavour in local storage and session base. Security is per session and per domain. Capacity is between 2 to 10 MB. Web storage is client only (don’t need to send every time to the server) and larger capacity unlike cookies. It has simple API, key/value pair and widespread availability.

- Two types – dedicated (linked to browser that spawned the worker so it has a very tight relationship), shared (runs in the background and basically any script that’s running within that domain can send messages to that worker. It is largely unimplemented in browser currently.).

- The data which is stored in a sandbox so if website A creates it then it cannot be access by website B. local storage will work as session storage if working in private mode. Data is serialized to file system in a hard drive outside of the browser. It is synchronous.
- Browser represent a web page in memory is through the document object model.

- Using javascript we cannot set a class using .class, we need to use classList as class is a reserved word.
- To indicate emphasis use italic tag in the text, we can use `<em>` for meaning purpose and `<i>` for just styling purpose. So, use `<em>` not `<i>`, same with use `<strong>` not `<b>`.
- HTML is derived from SGML.

- Why should we structure our text – users can get to information quickly, enables accessibility tools to understand information, enables browsers to style the content, helps search engines to understand content.

- The term progressive enhancement refers to the use of newer features that add to the experience in modern browsers that support those features, but doesn’t detract from the experience in older browsers.
- URL part composition

![html-url-parts-composition](./images/html-url-parts-composition.png)

- ARIA full form - Accessible rich internet applications

- types of selectors - The pseudo classes are just something that the browser will implicitly apply.

![css-types-of-selectors](./images/css-types-of-selectors.png)

- The 1.0em; states for the size which is default to the page. If we say width: 50%; then it will be half of its parent width.

- We also have a star selector which matches everything on the page:

```css
* {
  color: White;
}
```

- Ordering rules – if two conflicting rules are coming from the same source it just uses the last rule.

- CSS Reset – it is a stylesheet that effectively override the default styles given by a web browser for all HTML elements. Because every browser has slightly different default styles, it will remove this different in style by making it all to reset. There are many available like from yahoo, meyerweb.com. we need to just give the reference of that stylesheet to our main page.

- Specificity – the higher is the specificity number the more important the rule is. It contains 3 parts ABC like below:

![css-specificity](./images/css-specificity.png)

- Inheritance – some property values of an element will be inherited form the elements parents. Like text in div which is inside paragraph will inherit paragraph font size. But border, margin, paddings will not inherited form the parents. So, border set on paragraph will not have border on div or em or other tags inside it.

- Vertical margins collapse – when top and bottom margins meet they will overlap or collapse, technically the will overlap until one of the margins touches the border. But horizontal margins do not collapse.

- Width – when we specify the exact width it will specify of the content area. Any border, margin, or padding that we add will add to the width and require more space.

![css-width](./images/css-width.png)

- Layout with CSS - default position value is static. it stacked up elements one after the other down the page. relative position moves an element from its default position in some direction. we can set the top and left properties values. fixed and absolute removes the elements from the flow of documents. Absolute position moves an element to a specific position relative to the body of the document the top and left will be consider from the body element. while fixed position is relative to the window itself. When we apply relative position, we can set top or left kind of properties on it, it is unlike the padding and margin. It will sit on top on the element instead of just pushing them around.

![css-position](./images/css-position.png)

- Fixed positioning – it fixes the position of an element relative to the browser window. The element always stays fixed in place, even when scrolling. Generally, we use this in menu bar or navigation.

- Absolute positioning – it will not scroll with the browser window unlike fixed positioning. It takes an element out of the document flow, meaning the browser acts as if the element has no width and height, and the other elements on the page move up as if it was never there.

- By default, if the element is inside a container and we apply absolute on the element then it will relative to the body top left corner, but if we apply absolute on the container as well then it will be relative to that container.

- Relative Positioning - in this, other elements do not ignore its width and height. It doesn’t take out from the document flow. The original space will be maintained. The bottom: 0 value will make it to stay as it is because the bottom will be the same bottom of the element unlike absolute which will move it to the bottom of the window. And setting the position of the container element as relative does nothing at all unlike absolute positioning. If we have container with relative positioning and element as absolute, then the element will be relative to the container.

- Z-index – it allows us to control the stacking order of the elements. It will start from the negative value -1 and all the way up to highest z-index value.

- We should not have an orphan character on a new line, we can use typography module to make last two letters with “no break space” on every line.

- Instead of putting money to make UI better for older browser which market is going down, we should put it in the modern browser to make it better for future.

- Visual break points in Bootstrap

![css-bootstrap-visual-break-points](./images/css-bootstrap-visual-break-points.png)

- types of selectors - relational, attribute, structural

- Relational selectors

![css-relational-selectors](./images/css-relational-selectors.png)

- Other selectors

![css-other-selectors](./images/css-other-selectors.png)

- Earlier we use table-based layout, then fluid-based layout came, now flexbox is the latest layout technique.

- The full name of flexbox is flexible box module, it is an extension of display property. It is a set of CSS properties to create flexible layouts and distributing extra space and aligning content. Because in CSS block, inline, table and positioning properties do not provide enough control for flexible layout, it becomes hacky and awkward to layout some more complex web applications which is why flexbox has been created.

- Flexbox is all about the relationship between a parent container and its direct descendant child items named by flex-container and flex-items. Flexbox was made for layout, float was not.

- Flexbox controls how items flow in one dimension, where the grid controls how items flow in two dimensions. Flexbox is great in handling alignment, distribution and order of content in space. CSS grid on the other hand is suited to lay items out in both dimensions. CSS grid, like flexbox, is all about the relationship between parent container and child items, grid-container, grid-items. It establishes a grid context for its children.

![css-flex-layout-vs-grid](./images/css-flex-layout-vs-grid.png)

- Responsive web design is a technique for creating a website that adapts to accommodate various device widths. It involves Fluid Grid, media queries, flexible images.

- raster vs. vector images

![css-raster-vs-vector-images](./images/css-raster-vs-vector-images.png)

- JPEG format usage: progressive JPEG means it will render with the lowest quality first then get improved over time, unlike normal JPEG which gets render line by line paint with full quality. It is a best format for photos, lossy compression and progressive.

- Other formats - GIF (now a days use in animation only), PNG (lossy compression not as much as JPEG, mainly used to allow transparency scenario), WEBP (created by google, animation and transparency, limited browser support), SVG (XML vector image format, points, lines, shapes, resolution independent).

- We use use SVG images wherever possible.

- Lossy optimizer and lossless optimizer: the lossless compression will remove lots of metadata/properties information from the file without affecting its visual quality unlike lossy which don’t remove the metadata info but other data related to visual looks.

- Use radio buttons for less than 5 options, use dropdown for more than 5 options.

- CSS is crafted to be simple, but scaling simplicity is difficult. It is Sass not SASS, full form is syntactically awesome stylesheets. Its extension is “.scss”.

- We should follow mobile first approach, then add media queries rules medium and large screen as required. So, we don’t have to add media queries in CSS reset and small screen. Due to this maximum CSS style rules will in small.css, then fewer in medium.css and few in large.css:

![css-mobile-first-approach-style-files](./images/css-mobile-first-approach-style-files.png)

- In progressive enhancement we first apply rule for small screen then by media query apply rules for medium screen and then finally for large screen.

- Icons are vector based not pixel-based like the sprites, this means icons are very smooth specially on screens with high resolutions.

- Flexbox is a collection of CSS properties used to align content and distribute space. It includes concepts such as flex containers, flex items and flex lines. Flex containers control layout of child items.

- The flexbox model provides an efficient way to layout a line and distribute space among elements within our document. By this we can control the layout of children in a parent container. We can tell the children to line up left to right or right to left, or top to bottom or bottom to top, we can tell them fit on one line or wrapped to multiple lines. We can control the spacing around images and text and align the items either top or bottom. By this we can make responsive design much easier. We can use flexbox for creating an image gallery website.

- When not to use flexbox – they are good for simple layout where we can control over the components. But they are not meant for complex application grid systems. Better suited for individual components. So, should use more CSS grids instead of flexbox on entire page. Flexbox provide limited control over order. CSS grids provides better control over text layouts.

- The Origins of Styling Scroll - 1920’s cartoons are the earlier example of scrolling effect, often used when character was walking. In 1980’s video games used the same technique as cartoons but added triggers which increase interest. Web designers began using parallax scrolling in 2011, Early design used only 2 layers.

- Responsive design got started when Steve Jobs launched iPhone in 2007 with web browser. Four mobile strategy - ignore them, build a seperate mobile web site, build an app for the apple store, build a responsive site

- In 2007 iPhone release a phone in which he made the browser tell a lie to the website that it is having desktop size browser and then it shrinking the size to fit on the mobile, in other mobile on those days were not able to render complete website and making the website unusable. But as a responsive design now a days we want to know the actual size of browser on mobile not a lie, so we need to add below tag.

```html
<meta
  name="viewport"
  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0. maximum-scale=1.0. user-scalable=0"
/>
```

- Pseudo classes allow us to conditionally select an element based on state or position, they start with a colon `(:)`.

- 12 column grid layout – it has history in newspaper because when we had multiple editions coming out in a single day, we need to lay them out quickly and 12 columns can easily be divided into halves, quarters or thirds. So, it is an easy layout to achieve.

- The `data-*` attributes on HTML allows us to store extra information on standard, semantic HTML elements without other hacks, such as non-standard attributes, extra properties on DOM, or Node.setUserData(). So, they are allows us to target javascript.

- By using forkJoin we can make two calls simultaneously, it is like q.all() functionality in promises, these calls will happen in parallel.

- Popover – It is like tooltip but gives us additional features like title. Tooltips are usually smalls, quick hints, and appear on hover. Popovers have an explicit title area and get additional related content. They are generally bigger and typically dismiss with click rather than hover status, popovers are more like a modal.

- Fonts of a typeface –

![css-fonts-of-a-typeface](./images/css-fonts-of-a-typeface.png)

- Anatomy of typeface –

![css-anatomy-of-a-typeface](./images/css-anatomy-of-a-typeface.png)

- Hyphenation – dividing words at the end of a line. Doesn’t look clean. No clear advantage. On digital application do not hyphenate.

![css-hyphenation](./images/css-hyphenation.png)

- Don’t put indent first paragraph in digital world –

![css-indent](./images/css-indent.png)

- Use all caps sparingly – instead of this try to use title cases

- Pull quotes – it should not be a copy of original text.

![css-pull-quotes](./images/css-pull-quotes.png)

- Use maximum two different typefaces in the application like serif and sans-serif. Like one for header and another for content. We can use website fontjoy.com and fontinuse.com for font pairing.

- Font file types –TrueType (.TTF), OpenType (.OTF), Web Open Font Format (.WOFF), Embedded Open Type (.EOT)

- Pseudo-classes - :hover, :nth-of-type, :first-of-type, :last-of-type, :nth-child, :first-child, :last-child

- CSS grid properties –

![css-grid-properties](./images/css-grid-properties.png)

- Building colors in RGB

![css-rgb-colors](./images/css-rgb-colors.png)

- Different ways to represent colors – RGB, CYMK, HSL, HSV and Pantone. RGB rules the world.

- Choosing an image format (bitmap, tiff, compressed TIFF, gif, jpeg) only gif and jpeg can be used over the internet. Use gif for illustrations, logs and backgrounds and jpeg for photographs. We don’t use gif for photos because the compression would be lousy and if we use jpeg for illustration then its compression will be lousy.

- Portable network graphics (PiNG) because GIF compression was patented. PiNG (PNG) provides lossless compression means we can save it over and over again without losing information. JPEG still have smaller size than PNG. But PNGs don’t do animation. GIF and PNG can do transparency, JPEG cannot. Transparency allows the color of the parent layer to shine through. So, use PNG unless we are sure you need JPEG, JPEG compression is lossy, don’t use for working copies.

- Rater vs. vector based images – for vector we use .svg files -

![css-raster-vs-vector-images2](./images/css-raster-vs-vector-images2.png)

- CSS filters – we can apply effects on images or other elements. Supported filters – blur, brightness, contrast, drop-shadow, gray-scale, hue-rotate, invert, opacity, saturate, sepie

- What is missing in CSS – no CSS constant and no cross browser supports, for this we should use SASS. SASS is the technology platform and SCSS is syntax. It has more features like nested style as below second one is more cleaner with SASS. SASS modules – color, list, map, math, meta, selector, string.

- Difference between without and with fluid container in flexbox – The grid will take all unused horizontal space.

- Theme colors –

![css-theme-colors](./images/css-theme-colors.png)

- We can use Cypress to test any web application built on any type of technology. - It has four key folders – fixtures, integrations, support and plugins.

- Best practices – we should avoid using id’s or css classes to select element from the DOM, it will make the test brittle, because those things are likely to change. We should either use data attribute or actual component name itself.

- With Cypress, all related things are available out of the box –

![cypress-things-available](./images/cypress-things-available.png)

- Cypress command API – it is a chained API where subject is passed through the chain.

![cypress-chained-api](./images/cypress-chained-api.png)

- Test commands are executed in a deterministic manner, resulting in flake-free testing. Cypress will automatically wait for this assertion “.should” (4 seconds by default). So we don’t need to write code for wait and sleep until element is ready

- In cypress we can also stub network response with fixtures by using cy.server() command.

- Whereas selenium executes remote commands through the network, Cypress runs in the same run-loop as our application. Other tools like protector uses selenium under the hood unlike Cypress. It provides features like real time loading, time travel, consistent results.

- Selenium and similar tools were designed to test applications that require a full-page refresh. Supporting SPAs with Ajax data fetching was an afterthought. This lead to many issues with timing and flakey tests. Tests would sometimes fail due to slow API requests or network latency. Fixing these flakey tests typically required adding sleep statements and increasing timeouts. This made the test code more brittle. Not to mention extremely slow.

- It’s worth mentioning Google’s Puppeteer has inner access to web browser events, allowing us to wait on things like Ajax calls. However, writing tests with Puppeteer requires more initial setup work and more effort to write each test than it should.

- Cypress.io is a relatively new framework. It overcomes many shortcomings found in Selenium, Phantom.js, and others before them. It uses an event-based architecture that hooks into Google Chrome’s lifecycle events. This enables it to wait for things like Ajax requests to complete without using a polling/timeout mechanism. This leads to reliable and fast tests. In short, it is truly the future of E2E testing and how it should have been in the first place.

- You can run Cypress in two modes: full-mode and headless-mode. The former lets you see your app’s UI and tests performed one step at a time. This mode is excellent for building up your test suite and debugging. The latter is great for a Continuous Integration (CI) environment. Another use case for headless-mode: you just want to make sure you haven’t broken anything with new changes but don’t care about the detailed steps.

- Headless-mode is useful for running on a Continuous Integration (CI) server like CircleCI. Once you start writing tests more regularly as part of your development, you should invest time in getting a CI server configured so that every git commit runs the entire test suite.

- Cypress is an end-to-end framework that was created by Brian Mann, who wanted to solve some pain points that a lot of developers face when writing integration tests: hard to write, unreliable and too slow. Similar to TestCafe, it was built on top of Node, with no dependencies on Selenium, and is a standalone testing framework that supports Javascript.

- You can have a 100% code coverage with unit-tests that test all your components in isolation, but your application might still fail when components start to communicate with each other.

- The real important tests are the ones that test functionalities that your users use every day. These are things like: “Can a user buy a product?” and “Will my order be shipped to the right address if I change the address later?” These kinds of things are impossible to test with unit tests, as they use all components of your application.

- Cypress additional events -

- .click(), .click({force: true}), .click(5, 10), .click('topLeft'), .type('text'), .type('text', {delay: 10}), .type({backspace}), .select('value'), .select('val', {log: false}), .select([val1, val2]),

- Cypress commands do not return their subjects. They yield them. Cypress commands are asynchronous.

- Cypress uses retry-ability for the commands automatically to avoid hard code waits. Below if the assertion is failed then it will go back to the command and wait for a certain period of time

- It only retries commands that query the DOM like get(), find() or contains(). Commands that are not retried are the ones that could potentially change the state of the application. Also, it will only retry the last command before the expression like in below it will do the several retry for the .find() but no retry for the get().

![cypress-querying](./images/cypress-querying.png)

- Types of commands – parent command start a new change and ignore previously yielded subject, child command cannot be directly used and need to apply on parent command or another child command. The dual commands can do both.

![cypress-types-of-commands](./images/cypress-types-of-commands.png)

- It is suggested to do the clean-up before and not after tests.

- There are two design pattern while writing the E2E to make it more maintainable and free from future breakage – Page Object Model and App Actions.

- App Actions is an approach where tests directly access the internal implementation of the application under test. It enable changing application’s state without interacting with the application through the UI.

- Page Object model is a wrapper over a web page and a design pattern where web pages are represented as classes. Encapsulates the mechanics required to interact with the user interface. Second one, is the example for page object. By creating page object classes, it will increase the maintainability, code reusability and readability of our code.

- We should identify steps to automate through the UI and then use the App Actions for supporting steps. Like for login workflow use it once by browser interaction and then for other dependent tests use via App Actions. Also, we should use precise and future proof selectors.

- Before and After Cypress –

![cypress-before-and-after](./images/cypress-before-and-after.png)

- While writing the plugins, they run in Cypress background tasks in Node, since they executed in Node not in the browser, we can’t use Cypress syntax while writing plugins code.

- By using plugins, we can modify or extend the internal behavior of Cypress. We can write our own custom code that executes during different Cypress stages. By this we can also tap into node process running outside the browser. We can also alter the configuration and environment variables or customize how test code is transpired and sent to browser or to manipulate the database.

- Javascript mouse events are easy but CSS mouse events are hard. Cypress can’t easily trigger pseudo-classes like :hover. There are docs and options for this, but it is difficult.

- We should not select element by using text. We should use consistent selectors like id, class. Even better, use test-specific attributes like `<div data-cy="myElement"/>`

- Benefits of automated tests vs. manual human –

![cypress-automation-vs-manual-tests](./images/cypress-automation-vs-manual-tests.png)

- Subcutaneous tests – a level above than the unit and integration tests and just below the surface of the UI. In this we can test all the non-UI components working together.

![cypress-functional-ui-tests](./images/cypress-functional-ui-tests.png)

- We should write the smallest number of tests possible to reach the required level of quality or confidence in the system being developed.

- Characteristics of good automated tests – isolated (no side effects on other tests), independent (can be run in any order), repeatable (always pass or fail), maintainable, valuable.

- When a bug is found, a failing automated test can be written to reproduce it. When the bug is fixed the test will pass. In some future change, if the bug reoccurs it will be caught by the automated test.

- Conceptually, observables are more about handling events than managing data that is also one of the reason to adapt Signals.

- HTML 5 storage API – session (per origin and per instance, tied to domain origin) storage, local storage.

- Local storage is also attached to per origin but available across all browser instances.

- Storage API issues – function are synchronous, no access from web workers, vulnerable to XSS attacks.

- We should not store any sensitive data in storage. The storage API is designed for simple key-value storage. We can save the complex object as-well but we need to stringy if before saving, but it causes the performance overhead.

- Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded operation.

- Common full stack technology stack - Python + Django, PHP + Laravel, NextJs + React, Nuxt + Vue

- URL segments - <https://example.logto.io:8080/blogs/index.html?param1=value1&param2=value2#introduction> - Scheme, Host, Port, Path, Query Parameters, Fragment Identifier

- HTML is a parser language or abstract layer for C++ to parse on the browser. The browser are very good at networking and timers capabilities.

![browser-behind-the-scene](./images/browser-behind-the-scene.png)

- Browser works on simple working concept to display the data and provide interaction to the user. It converts the token into scattered objects which gets constructed into the Document Object Model.

![browser-html-node-list](./images/browser-html-node-list.png)

- Afterwards, to create the relations between them, it creates node list which is given by rendering engine.

![browser-html-node-list-afterwards](./images/browser-html-node-list-afterwards.png)

- Browser engine is very good at math to create render tree as per client screen size and components size based on CSS then it starts painting to actually showing elements on the UI. Whenever browser sees a script tag it will stop executing the DOM or whatever works it is doing, the first preference always goes to JS as JS has the capability to modify DOM or CSS so no point to painting before evaluating all the JS. That is why we should not first send the JS but the HTML and CSS so that browser will show the page without any delay on first load, then send the JS for interactivity. However in case of CSSOM, JS execution will be halted until CSSOM is ready.

![browser-html-render-tree](./images/browser-html-render-tree.png)

- JWT has three segments, each separated by dots. If it is a base64-encoded JSON then its first two segments would start from characters "eyJ" because when decode it becomes base64({"). First part it has Header that describes the token itself and how to read & validate the token. It has properties like type, alg and kid. The second part is the payload, it is the content of the token itself. It contains claims about the entity. The final part is the signature value, it is created using the header, payload and signing key. Its length varies based on the algorithm and key.

- The JWT pronounce as "jot". It is originally created by the OAuth working group due to demand for JSON representation of claims and to replace SAML assertion.

- When to use JWTs – for API access, for information transfer (identity token), security proofs. We should always use JWTs in combination with something else like OAuth or Open Identity Connect protocols where rules are defined and low risk of misuse.

- JWTs are not a replacement for cookies and sessions. Browsers cannot maintain JWT sessions, we have to implement token storage and management. There is no out-of-the-box method to invalidate a single JWT.

- We should not store application or permission data as we should keep our JWTs small as it can easily hit header size limits.

- JOSE (JavaScript object signing and encryption) standards – JWON Web Tokens, JSON Web Signature, JSON Web Encryption, JSON Web Key, JSON Web Algorithms.

- Initial format check of JWT - three sections, two dots, base64url data, valid JSON objects.

- We should first validate the token like checking the issuer, subject value, audience, expiration date, before parsing it.

- JWE has 5 distinct section instead of 3 of JWT –

![misc-technical-jwe](./images/misc-technical-jwe.png)

- When to use JWE – if we use PII (personally identifiable information) like names, email address street address, IP address, account number, telephone number etc., if token needs to be passed through multiple systems (including the 3rd party).

- Skill transfer is very easy in angular, as most of the angular projects looks the same. When you use angular, you are getting everything like route, forms package, http package, there is a kind of prescribed way to code with angular but products like react are much more pick and choose, so you can choose which router you want, which http package you want to use.
  By low-code we can deliver better software faster. One way is to abstracting automating things so professional developers can go faster. It also takes the constraint away from people who can only build that and it open an ability to adapt to this new world in real time with people who has no traditional skills in software development. It provides speed, simplicity, no huge army of engineers and get live quickly and save tons of the cost to the business, anybody can develop software, business and IT will be on same page by providing common language, has guidance and guard rails, no long red tape of processes.

- Chrome dev tools - Elements, console, sources tabs are called panel and windows inside each of them are called pane.

- Time begins on 1st jan 1970 with the unix epoch, when we say Date.now(), it gives milliseconds from this time.

- IDE's Evaluation - vi -> emics -> vim -> neo vim -> nano -> notepad++ -> Dreamweaver -> visual studio code -> visual studio -> WebStorm (features looks more reliable and polished than vs code)

- Choosing the framework depends whether website mostly have static content or highly interactive, if highly interactive then whether it needs SEO, if SEO and content rarely change like in blogs website then use JAM stack and pre-render the content and cache on the CDN. if dynamic content then need full SSR + hydration.

- Angular bootstrap process - angular.json (main) -> main.ts (bootstrapModule) -> app.module (bootstrap) -> app.component -> app.component.html -> index.html (`<app-root></app-root>` selector is used as an element to get the app component) -> The javascript files {runtime.js, polyfile.js, … etc } are responsible to make our application a single page and they are handled by the browser itself. But, the Html code should be available in our application itself.

- Google searching tips - cut the crap - Forget "what," "how," and other words that serve only a syntactical purpose. Demand answers using meaningful and descriptive verbs example - instead of 'what is algorithmic complexity' use 'define algorithmic complexity'. Order keywords from broad to specific, instead of 'consume an api using typescript with axios' use 'typescript axios consume api'. Use Images for Diagrams and Visualizations. Many times, Images will contain concise and informative graphics that will answer your question much faster than a web page could.

- Useful http status codes - 100 Information - 100 — Continue; 101 — Switching protocol; 103 — Checkpoints. 200 Successful. 300 Redirection - 301 — Moved Permanently; 302 — Found; 304 — Not Modified; 305 — Use Proxy; 307 — Temporary Redirect. 400 Client Errors - 400: Bad Request; 401: Unauthorized; 403: Forbidden; 404: Not Found; 408: Request Timeout; 410: Gone; 429: Too Many Requests. 500 Server Errors - 500 — Internal Server Error; 502 — Bad Gateway; 503 — Service Unavailable; 504 — Gateway Timeout.

- Zero-day Exploits - Attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in software before the developer has issued a patch.

- Types of MFA - SMS codes, authenticator apps, hardware tokens.

- A piece of code should be where you expect to find it - and, if not, you should re-factor to get it there.

### YAML

- It is short for YAML aren't markup language. It is human-readable data serialization language. It can be used to keep and transfer the data. Its most common purposes is the configuration files. It is a true superset of JSON.

- YAML use cases – cross-language data sharing, configuration files, log files, object persistence, working with language like ruby, python, etc.

- It has two style – block (human readable) and flow (less human readable like JSON)

![misc-technical-block-vs-flow-style](./images/misc-technical-block-vs-flow-style.png)

- YAML - Building blocks – sequence (arrays), mapping (key-value) and scalar (string, number, boolean and dates). We should do indentation with spaces not with tabs. For list we need to use (-) and for key-value we need to `(:)`. Scalar values – with string values we can use quotes or without quotes. By using the `#` we can add comment.

- One YAML file can contain multiple documents. The documents can be separated by 3 hyphens (---).

![misc-technical-yaml-key-value-and-array](./images/misc-technical-yaml-key-value-and-array.png)

![misc-technical-yaml-nested-array](./images/misc-technical-yaml-nested-array.png)

![misc-technical-yaml-nested-mappings](./images/misc-technical-yaml-nested-mappings.png)

- Explicit typing – by using like !!str is an explicit typing which will convert the date into a string type.

![misc-technical-yaml-explicit-typing](./images/misc-technical-yaml-explicit-typing.png)

- Repeated nodes – to avoid code repeat.

![misc-technical-repeated-nodes](./images/misc-technical-repeated-nodes.png)

- Processing of YAML –

![misc-technical-processing-of-yaml](./images/misc-technical-processing-of-yaml.png)

- YAML vs. JSON – YAML is standard for configuration and JSON is standard for service API.

![misc-technical-yaml-vs-json](./images/misc-technical-yaml-vs-json.png)

- YAML vs. XML

![misc-technical-yaml-vs-xmsl](./images/misc-technical-yaml-vs-xmsl.png)

- GitLab is a single platform that provides entire DevOps toolchain for organizations of any scale and size.

- A pipeline contains below things – jobs, runners, stages

- To create table of contents from headings automatically, we can use [[*TOC*]] syntax.

- Github is a cloud based git repository hosting service.

- We can run a workflow on any Github event –

![misc-technical-github-events](./images/misc-technical-github-events.png)

- Anonymous comments can cause serious damage to your website's reputation.

- WWW or no WWW – whether your website is brand-new or has been hosted for a few months already will depend entirely on its stage. If it brand-new, you must definitely choose whether to use www or non-www in the URL of your site.

- CSS was designed to format technical document, that was its purpose of life, but that is not what we use it for. We use it for all kinds of stuff that it is very badly suited for. We use it as it is only option.

- URI stands for Uniform Resource Identifier, this is used to reference web pages, images, videos, files and pretty much any resource available to a computer, tablet, or smart phone, the browser processes in terms of URI. jQuery use term of URL for web pages.

- It seems that perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to subtract.

- Danger driven development – where we are doing crazy reckless stuff in the code just to keep in interesting. Always take the time to code well.

- We can ship a software update if we have added value without removing any existing value even though the new value feature is not complete, so user can't still use it from UI, it is called dark release.

- By using Electron, we can create cross platform desktop applications.

- Signal observe state (variable values) not event or data that arrives over time. the computation signal derived its value from other signals, it should be side-effect free means it should write to any signal, also the computed value is memorized.

- signal = data value + change notifications

```typescript
const quantity = signal<number>(1);
this.quantity.set(newQty);
this.quantity.update(v => v.2);
```

- an effect is an operation that runs whenever one or more signal values change, we can use it to aid in debugging signals. we should not normally change state/value of a signal as it can lead to a circular updates and extra change detect cycles.

- in service we should use rxjs to get the data from the service but from service we should only expose signals. signals are great for optimizing rendering.

- While ARIA is a powerful tool for enhancing accessibility, it should be used as a last resort. Native semantic HTML elements and attributes are preferred whenever possible, as they provide built-in accessibility features that ARIA does not have to replicate. Always prefer native elements like <button>, <label>, <nav> and <header> over their ARIA counterparts. For example, instead of using role="button" on a <div>, use a <button> element. Speaking about ARIA roles, they define what an HTML element is or how it should behave – when native HTML elements are not applicable. They tell assistive technologies how to interpret an element and its purpose within the page. Roles are particularly useful for custom components that don’t have native semantic meaning.

- 96% of the detected accessibility issues fall into 6 buckets. Here are the buckets from most to least common:

  - Low-contrast text: 79.1%
  - Missing alternative (alt) text for images: 55.5%
  - Missing form input labels: 48.2%
  - Empty links: 45.4%
  - Empty buttons: 29.6%
  - Missing document language: 15.8%

- Batching, Fan Out and scheduling concepts in System Design

- Angular CDK Accessibility - LiveAnnouncer, FocusTrap, Regions, FocusMonitor, CSS class as cdk-visually-hidden and cdk.high-contrast.

- Zoneless angular

  - What Still Works - Event-driven updates: user interactions or async operations still trigger change detection. Signals: seamlessly notify and refresh dependent views. AsyncPipe: continues to mark components dirty automatically. ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck() works for manual control. These mechanisms uphold reactivity without relying on Zone.js

  - What Breaks / Needs Manual Handling - Operations outside Zone.js context, such as timers or setInterval, won't auto-trigger updates — use markForCheck() or signals instead. Legacy apps or UI libraries that depend on Zone.js–style "magic" behavior might malfunction until migrated. Adopting component OnPush strategy is vital to reap the full benefits and ensure your app stays reactive

  - Why It Matters - Bundle size & performance: removing Zone.js reduces payload and startup overhead. Improved Core Web Vitals: fewer, smarter change-detection cycles speed up runtime performance. Better debugging: no more obscure stack traces from patched async APIs. Ecosystem-friendly: fewer conflicts with native browser APIs or external libraries that don't expect Zone.js behavior. Angular is clearly pointing toward this as the future: signals, hydration, and zoneless mode form a more direct, Solid/Vue‑like DX.

The link you shared — [W3C QA Tip: "Don't use 'click here' as link text"](https://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/noClickHere) — is a best practice guideline from the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).

- Don't use "click here" as link text - Avoid using vague link text like **“click here”**, because it:

  - **Lacks context**: Screen readers or people skimming the page may not understand where the link leads.
  - **Hurts accessibility**: For visually impaired users using screen readers, hearing "click here" repeatedly doesn't help them navigate.
  - **Reduces usability**: It forces users to read surrounding text to understand what the link does.
  - **Hurts SEO**: Search engines use link text to understand the content of the linked page. "Click here" gives no useful info.
  - Use **descriptive link text** that clearly tells users where they'll go if they click. like `Learn more about our \[privacy policy].` instead of `To read more, \[click here].` This makes your content **clearer, more accessible, and user-friendly**.

- Use below approach to disable on the form by using signal

```html
<button [disabled]="disableForm()">Submit</button>
<button [disabled]="disableForm()">Save Draft</button>
```

```typescript
disableForm = computed(() => this.formInvalid() || this.formPending());
```

- Android architecture - Linux kernel, android runtime & libraries, application framework, applications.

- Certificate pining binds your application to specific server certificate or public key, preventing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks even if a rogue CA is trusted by the system. static pinning and dynamic pinning.

- Secure app development practices - define minimal permission sets, runtime permission testing, implement certificate pinning, conduct regular security audits, leverage operating-system APIs.

- NFC security measures - enable NFC on-demand, use secure elements for payments, shield against relay, audit installed NFC apps.

- After 10 failed attempts, automatically wipe device (optional for highly sensitive use).

Angular’s recent changes are moving in the "don’t rebuild the browser, use the browser" direction that the “SPA Is Dead” article talks about. Angular is slowly stepping away from the “full heavy SPA” mindset and toward leveraging modern browser features, server rendering, and minimal JavaScript for the same smooth experience.

Certainly! Building upon the best practices from Sean Goedecke’s article on API design, here are some additional best practices for enhancing screen reader support in CSS:

---

## 🎯 CSS Best Practices for Screen Reader Support

### 1. **Use `visibility` and `display` Carefully**

Screen readers treat `display: none` and `visibility: hidden` as non-existent elements. Avoid using these properties to hide content that should be accessible to assistive technologies. Instead, consider using `aria-hidden="true"` to hide elements from screen readers while keeping them visually hidden.([JavaScript in Plain English][1])

**Example:**

```css
/* Avoid this */
.hidden {
  display: none;
}

/* Instead, use */
.hidden {
  visibility: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  margin: -1px;
  padding: 0;
  border: 0;
}
```

### 2. **Avoid `display: contents` on Interactive Elements**

Using `display: contents` on interactive elements like buttons or links can cause them to lose their semantic meaning, making them inaccessible to screen readers. Ensure that interactive elements retain their semantic roles.([JavaScript in Plain English][1], [bbc.github.io][2])

**Example:**

```html
<!-- Avoid this -->
<button style="display: contents;">
  <span>Click me</span>
</button>

<!-- Instead, use -->
<button>
  Click me
</button>
```

### 3. **Keep Text Accessible When Using Images or Icons**

When using images or icons, ensure that any important text is still accessible to screen readers. Use `aria-label` or `alt` attributes to provide descriptive text for images and icons.([JavaScript in Plain English][1])

**Example:**

```html
<!-- Avoid this -->
<img src="icon.png" alt="">

<!-- Instead, use -->
<img src="icon.png" alt="Search icon">
```

### 4. **Don't Break the Reading Order**

Avoid using CSS to visually reorder content in a way that disrupts the logical reading order. Screen readers follow the DOM order, so ensure that the visual and logical orders align.

**Example:**

```css
/* Avoid this */
.reversed {
  order: -1;
}

### 5. **Use Semantic HTML and ARIA Roles**

Ensure that your HTML structure is semantic and that you use appropriate ARIA roles to convey meaning to screen readers. This helps users understand the purpose and behavior of elements.

**Example:**

```html
<!-- Use semantic HTML -->
<article>
  <header>
    <h1>Article Title</h1>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p>Article content...</p>
  </section>
</article>

<!-- Use ARIA roles when necessary -->
<div role="navigation">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

-----------

Here’s a **best practices guide for UI flows that convert**, with **practical examples** for each principle from Ryan Almeida’s article:

---

## 🎯 1. Start with the End in Mind

**Best Practice:** Define the goal clearly and design the flow to achieve it with minimal steps.
**Example:**

- Goal: User signs up for a newsletter.
- Flow: Landing page → Email input → “Sign Up” button → Confirmation page.
  No extra fields like “Phone number” or “Favorite color” that could distract.

---

## ✂️ 2. Eliminate Unnecessary Steps

**Best Practice:** Remove steps that don’t directly help the user complete the goal.
**Example:**

- Instead of a multi-page checkout with unnecessary surveys, combine essentials:
  Product selection → Shipping → Payment → Confirmation.
- Skip optional account creation until after purchase.

---

## 🗣️ 3. Use Clear, Conversational Language

**Best Practice:** Use simple, direct language that’s easy to understand.
**Example:**

- Instead of: “Authenticate your credentials to proceed with the transaction,”
- Use: “Enter your password to continue.”

---

## 🧭 4. Guide Users, Don’t Force Them

**Best Practice:** Use visual cues and inline hints to lead users.
**Example:**

- Show a **progress bar** during a multi-step checkout.
- Highlight the next action button with color or animation.

---

## ⚠️ 5. Design for Human Error

**Best Practice:** Make it easy to recover from mistakes.
**Example:**

- Form: If the user types an invalid email, show “Oops! Please enter a valid email like [name@example.com](mailto:name@example.com)” instead of just “Invalid email.”
- Offer undo buttons for accidental deletions.

---

## 🧠 6. Reduce Cognitive Load

**Best Practice:** Limit choices and keep UI consistent.
**Example:**

- Show **3–5 payment options** instead of 20.
- Keep buttons, labels, and colors consistent across pages.

---

## 🎯 7. Align with User Expectations

**Best Practice:** Follow familiar patterns so users don’t need to learn your interface.
**Example:**

- Use a shopping cart icon at the top right (common convention).
- Use standard “hamburger menu” for mobile navigation.

---

## 🔁 8. Continuously Test and Iterate

**Best Practice:** Regularly test your flow with real users and refine.
**Example:**

- Run A/B tests for signup button color (“Green” vs “Blue”) and see which converts better.
- Observe user behavior: If many drop off at the payment page, simplify payment options or add hints.

---

If you want, I can **turn this into a compact “UI Flow Checklist”** that you can use while designing any product. It’ll be ready-to-use with examples included.

Do you want me to do that?

Above the Fold - The part of a web page that users see without scrolling. The phrase comes from newspaper printing, where the most important headlines and stories were placed on the upper half of the front page — the part visible when the paper was folded. Example: Move the pricing info above the fold so users don’t miss it.

Viewport - The visible area of a web page inside a user’s screen. It changes depending on screen size and orientation.
Example: A mobile phone has a narrow viewport, so images and text need to scale down and fit within that space without horizontal scrolling.

Material Design - A design language developed by Google in 2014 that uses clear hierarchy, bold colors, smooth motion, and realistic shadows. Despite being developed over 10 years ago, Material Design is still relevant and Google continues updating it.

Motion-Responsive - Interfaces that respond to movement — like tilting, shaking, or gestures. Motion responsiveness is a growing trend in design, especially in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). For instance, Apple’s Vision Pro headset uses motion responsiveness to track eye and hand movements.

Flat Design - A minimalist design style that avoids 3D effects like shadows and gradients and focuses on clean shapes, bright colors, and simple icons.
Example: The background shifts slightly as you move your phone — it’s a motion-responsive UI.

# Interview

# Interview Questions - Angular

- What is SPA and PWA?

- The @Injectable() providedIn property vs. @NgModule() providers array

- Why angular 2 and how is the author (Misko Hevery)?

- Angular key features with each version upgrade (angular 3 - version mismatch between @angular/core, @angular/compiler and @angular/router libraries, angular 4 - emphasis on making angular apps more faster, compact, faster compilation, better bug fixes alert, angular 5 - build optimizer, compiler improvements, internationalized number, date and currency pipes, @angular/http is deprecated and replaced with @angular/common/http, HttpModule replaced with HttpClientModule, angular 6 - angular elements, library support, tree shakable providers, angular 7 - cli prompts, virtual scrolling, drag and drops, bundle budgets in cli, angular 8 - differential loading by default where browser chooses between modern or legacy JS based on its own capabilities, dynamic imports for route configurations, web worker support, ng deploy added into cli, angular 9 - ivy compiler, new options for providedIn, component harnesses, youtube player and google maps components, angular 10 - date range picker component, optional stricter settings, angular 11 - fixed few popular bug fixes, automatic font inlining, hot module replacement, faster builds, TSLint deprecation, remove ie9, ie10 and ie mobile support, angular 12 - nullish coalescing support, deprecated support for IE11, angular 13 - dynamic components, accessibility improvements for angular material components)

- How do you do angular upgrade for your project

- Angular bootstrapping flow - When an Angular application is started, the main.ts file is loaded first, here we bootstrap the root module i.e. app.module.ts. In this module, we specify a component as the bootstrap component and tell angular to load this component and all its dependencies at start up and register it’s selector app-root. Now when browser loads the index.html file, it knows what is app-root and render all the contents of this component.

- Query decorator - @ViewChild, @ViewChildren, @ContentChild, @ContentChildren

- Difference between ng-container, div and span.

- SkipSelf and Optional attributes

- Interceptors - logging, auth token, readonly, busy, cache

- Three types of data bindings – interpolation, event binding, property binding. Interpolation is a one way data binding. Angular does not have built-in two way data binding, however, by combining property binding and event binding we can achieve two way data binding.

- Inbuilt structural directives are `*ngFor`, `*ngIf` and attribute directives are`NgStyle`and`NgModel`

- Types of guards – resolve, can activate, can activate child, can deactivate, and can load (can load is like can activate but it will not even go get the contents, html and the javascript until it get satisfied it is used in lazy loading).

- Module attributes - Bootstrap, Declaration, Exports, Import, Providers

- The useExisting and useFactory Providers

- Main files of build folder - The main.js file contains all the code in our application, the polyfills.js file loads all the polyfill script to make sure it can be compatible with all the modern browsers. The runtime.js loads all the other files. The styles.js file loads the styles as the name suggests and vendor.js file loads all the imported libraries.

- Zone, Tree shaking, Standalone component, APP_INITIALIZER

- Reactive vs. Template driven forms with typed form vs. untyped form

- Regarding - NG0100: Expression has changed after it was checked

- Interceptors which one you have used in which scenarios

- Route guards which one you have used in which scenario and route resolvers?

- Class based route guards vs. functional route guards (as inject() is available now in angular 14)

- Angular performance improvements - pipe, destroying observables, track by function, proper bundle settings, lazy loaded modules, webpack explorer

- JIT vs. AOT, Ivy vs. View engine, forRoot vs. forChild, Component vs. Directive, Pure and Impure pipe

- Ivy - TView, LView and RView - When Ivy does rendering, it needs to keep track of three kinds of data: Template, Logical Tree, and Render Tree. These three concepts are shortened for brevity as T, L, and R prefix in many of our data structures. The template is the parsed version of the source code. It contains instructions for rendering the template in the form of Ivy-instructions and metadata about the component/directive. Logical-view (LView) represents instances of a template (TView). We use the word “logical” to highlight how the developer thinks about the application from a logical perspective. A ParentComponent contains a ChildComponent. From a logical perspective, we think about a ParentComponent containing a ChildComponent, hence the “logical” designation. The render tree is the actual DOM render tree. It is different from the logical tree above in that the render tree must take content projection into account. Because of this parent/child relationship is not as straightforward as in the logical view.

- Transclusion / Content projection, Template reference variable

- The angular.json file settings like prefix, builder, build, test lint, output path, main, index, assets, styles, script, production budgets, vendor chunk, extract licenses, source map, named chunks

- Do you use angular cli, why the need of the angular cli tool?

- Async pipe

- Subject vs. Subject Behaviour

- Hot observables vs. cold observables

- Schedulers

- Examples of custom directive - password strength, external link, format text, debounce click, tooltip, copy to clipboard, input mask, read more/less, age input, role-based access control, feature toggle based on role/permission

- State management options – angular service, NgRx, ngrx-data, observable store, Akita, Ngxs, MobX.

- switchMap (cancelable requests - searches), concatMap (run in sequence, when order is important), mergeMap (run parallel, when order is not important), exhaustMap (like for login when we don't want to make more request until initial one gets completed)

- What are Angular directives - Component directives, Attribute directives, Structural directives

- What is an AOT compilation? What are its benefits? Improved performance, Smaller bundle size, Early error detection

- Define lifecycle hooks in Angular - ngOnChanges, ngOnInit, ngDoCheck, ngAfterContentInit, ngAfterContentChecked, ngAfterViewInit, ngAfterViewChecked, ngOnDestroy

- How do we generate a class in Angular using CLI? - ng generate class myStore

- Types of Control Value Accessor (like checkbox, radio, number, range, select)

## Angular Material

- View encapsulation modes – none, emulated and shadowDom.

- How angular view encapsulation avoid overriding the component style from external style.

- How to get even disable form controls values from form group. (getRawValue())

- Which new angular material component you have used?

- Virtual scrolling

- MDC-based components

- Secondary Entry Points

```typescript
// Earlier
import { MatButtonModule, MatCardModule } from '@angular/material';

// Now
import { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button';
import { MatCardModule } from '@angular/material/card';

// One entrypoint:
// With secondary entrypoints:
```

## Unit Testing

- Benefits

- What is Test Harness?

- What is TestBed?

- Dependency injection?

- Testing structure types - AAA (Act, Arrange, assert), Behavioral (Given, When, Then)

- Styles of unit testing – output verification or functional verification, state verification, collaboration verification.

- Dummy vs. Stubs vs. Fake vs. Spy vs. Mock

- Test doubles – dummies like a placeholder, stubs objects that return predefined data, fakes slightly more realistic, mocks objects pre-programmed with expected outputs for given inputs and alsoD able to verify their calls, spies real object and verify interactions like mocks it is an hybrid of stubs, fakes and mocks.

- Marble testing is a technique where we draw marble diagrams using ACSII characters while writing unit test to visualize asynchronous observables behavior in a synchronous way. Benefits – readable code, test synchronously and helps to find out race condition in our code. Marble syntax - -, |, #, ^, !, a, ()

- debugEl with 'By' predicate vs. element.querySelector

- Have you used any e2e testing framework like cypress or protractor?

## HTML

- Semantic elements - header footer, section, nav, article, aside

- HTML 5 storage API – session (per origin and per instance, tied to domain origin) storage, local storage.

## CSS

- Block vs. inline elements

- Types of selectors - relational, attribute, structural, star selector

- Pseudo classes allow us to conditionally select an element based on state or position, they start with a colon (:) like :hover, :nth-of-type, :first-of-type, :last-of-type, :nth-child, :first-child, :last-child

- Specificity - id selector > class & attribute > type selector

- Z-index allows us to control the stacking order of the elements.

- Responsive web design using fluid grid, media queries, flexible images.

- 12 column grid layout and visual breakpoints

- Fallbacks and Polyfills – Fallback is to provide similar functionality as a native feature but maybe just with a different API. A Polyfills, on the other hand, is meant to replicate the exact same interface as well as functionality as how the native implementation would be built in the browser.

## Accessibility

- Have you considered Accessibility during your development?

- Web accessibility guidelines – WCAG (A, AA, AAA).

- aria attributes like aria-busy, aria-disabled, aria-grabbed, aria-hidden, aria-invalid.

## User Experience

- What is UX, some of its best practices or anti-patterns?

## Security

- Application security best practices or OWASP top 10? - CSP, Cross-site scripting, Broken Authentication, Sensitive data exposure, Security Misconfiguration

- When TDD Might Not Be Good - If deadlines are tight or you need to ship features quickly, probably don’t use TDD from the start. If the design or requirements are likely to change, heavily or often, TDD’s rigid structure of writing tests before code might cost more than it saves. Be pragmatic: use tests where they deliver the greatest value (e.g. for core logic, critical functions), rather than trying to enforce TDD everywhere.

Many Angular codebases misuse the effect() function when using Angular’s signal/reactive system — leading to infinite loops and performance problems. He suggests using linkedSignal() (new in Angular 20) instead, where appropriate. In many components, people use an effect() to “watch” signals and then update other signals based on those watched values. But when the same effect updates a signal that itself is part of the effect’s dependency chain, changing that signal triggers the effect again → and so on. That causes infinite loops or unnecessary repeated execution. If quantity is used in any part of that effect's logic (or in things downstream that feed back), it can trigger itself repeatedly.

// avoid
// WRONG: Using effect() to link signals
effect(() => {
  const productId = this.selectedProduct();
  const product = this.products.find(p => p.id === productId);
  this.quantity.set(product?.defaultQuantity ?? 1);
  // Problem: setting quantity may retrigger this effect
});

Use linkedSignal(), introduced in Angular 20, to define relationships between signals more cleanly. linkedSignal() creates a signal whose value is derived from others, rather than using manual effects for “signal linking.” This helps prevent loops and is more declarative.

// use
linkedSignal(() => {
  const product = this.products.find(p => p.id === this.selectedProduct());
  return product?.defaultQuantity ?? 1;
})

## Angular

### Avoid `nested subscriptions`

- Flatten or join inner observables using higher-order observables like `switchMap`. Nested subscriptions lead to callback hell and unreadable code.

  **Example (Do):**

  ```typescript
  todo$ = this.route.params.pipe(
    map((params) => +params['id']),
    switchMap((id) => this.todoStore.getTodoById(id))
  );
  ```

  **Example (Avoid):**

  ```typescript
  this.route.params.subscribe((params) => {
    const id = +params['id'];
    this.todoStore.todos.subscribe((todos) => {
      this.todo = todos.find((todo) => todo.id === id);
    });
  });
  ```

### Use proper naming for `subject` and `observable`

- Postfix `subject` variables with `Subject` and Postfix `observable` variables with `$`.

  **Example:**

  ```typescript
  private categorySelectionSubject = new Subject<number>();
  categorySelectedAction$ = this.categorySelectionSubject.asObservable();
  ```

### Avoid functions in `templates`

- Do not call functions directly within templates. Instead, use `pipes` or pre-calculated values for better performance. Also, Avoid embedding non-trivial logic in templates.

  **Example (Do):**

  ```html
  <span>{{ travelDetailsJson | travelDetails: 'source' }}</span>
  ```

  **Example (Avoid):**

  ```html
  <span>{{ getSourceDetails(travelDetailsJson) }}</span>
  ```

### Use `asapScheduler` instead of `setTimeout`

- Prefer `asapScheduler` from RxJS for delays to avoid blocking the event loop.

### Use `takeUntil` or `take(1)` for unsubscribing

- Use operators like `takeUntil` or `take(1)` for unsubscribing from observables to prevent memory leaks.

  **Example:**

  ```typescript
  private _destroyed$ = new Subject();

  ngOnInit(): void {
  iAmAnObservable.pipe(
      takeUntil(this._destroyed$)
  ).subscribe(value => this.textToDisplay = value);
  }

  ngOnDestroy(): void {
  this._destroyed$.next();
  this._destroyed$.complete();
  }
  ```

### Avoid logic inside `subscribe`

- Move logic from `subscribe` functions to keep code functional and cleaner.

  **Example (Do):**

  ```typescript
  pokemon$
    .pipe(
      filter(({ type }) => type !== 'Water'),
      map(getStats),
      tap(logStats)
    )
    .subscribe(save);
  ```

  **Example (Avoid):**

  ```typescript
  pokemon$.subscribe((pokemon) => {
    if (pokemon.type === 'Water') return;
    const stats = getStats(pokemon);
    logStats(stats);
    save(stats);
  });
  ```

### Use the `json` pipe for debugging

- Use the `json` pipe to display object data for debugging purposes.

  **Example:**

  ```html
  <div><pre>{{ profileForm | json }}</pre></div>
  ```

### Use child components with `ngFor`

- When using `ngFor`, consider breaking repeating logic into child components.

  **Example (Do):**

  ```html
  <user-detail *ngFor="let user of users" [user]="user"></user-detail>
  ```

  **Example (Avoid):**

  ```html
  <div *ngFor="let user of users">
    <h3>{{ user.name }}</h3>
    <span>{{ user.age }}</span>
  </div>
  ```

### Use `trackBy` with `ngFor`

- Use `trackBy` to improve performance by uniquely identifying elements in `ngFor`.

### Optimize images with `ngSrc` and set dimensions

- Use `ngSrc` for lazy loading images and set dimensions (`width` and `height`) to prevent layout shifts.

### Follow `Declarative Data Access` patterns

- Use the `async` pipe to manage data streams directly in templates, reducing the need for explicit subscription management.

  **Example:**

  ```html
  <div *ngIf="products$ | async as products">
    <button *ngFor="let product of products">{{ product.name }}</button>
  </div>
  ```

### Use `inject()` for Dependency Injection

- Prefer `inject()` for cleaner dependency management over a `constructor`.

  **Example:**

  ```typescript
  import { inject } from '@angular/core';
  import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

  export const fetchData = () => {
    const http = inject(HttpClient);
    return http.get('https://api.example.com/data');
  };
  ```

### Use `ngTemplateOutlet` for Template Reuse

- Leverage `ngTemplateOutlet` to dynamically reuse templates.

  **Example:**

  ```html
  <ng-template #template let-name="name">
    <h1>Hello {{ name }}</h1>
  </ng-template>

  <div *ngTemplateOutlet="template; context: { name: 'Angular' }"></div>
  ```

### Apply the `Adapter Pattern`

- Use the `Adapter Pattern` when integrating third-party libraries. This allows for the seamless replacement of the library later without major code changes.

### Avoid `placeholder` if it matches the `label`

- Do not use a `placeholder` if it is identical to the `label`. Use `placeholder` only to provide additional hints or tips. Repetition of information creates unnecessary duplication.

### Enclose `plain text` within elements

- Plain text in HTML should always be wrapped in an appropriate element like a `<div>` or `<span>`.

### Use `links` for non-form actions

- Use `links` instead of `buttons` for actions outside a form.

### Avoid `inline styles`

- Inline styles should be avoided. Use external stylesheets for consistency and reusability. Inline styles cannot be reused and make the HTML markup cluttered and hard to maintain.

### Prefer `class` selectors over `id` selectors

- Always use `class` selectors instead of `id` selectors because `class` selectors are reusable.

  **Example (Do):**

  ```html
  <header>
    <h4 class="sidebar-heading">Sub Heading</h4>
  </header>
  ```

  **Example (Avoid):**

  ```html
  <header>
    <h4 id="sidebar-heading">Sub Heading</h4>
  </header>
  ```

### Use the `hidden` attribute for visibility control

- Use the `hidden` attribute to hide elements instead of relying on JavaScript or CSS.

  **Example:**

  ```html
  <p hidden>This paragraph is hidden from view.</p>
  ```

### Implement `Typeahead` or `Combobox` for Large Lookups

- For lookups with numerous values, utilize a `Typeahead` or `Combobox` component. These provide both `select` and `textbox` functionality, improving the user experience. Otherwise, Users may struggle to navigate through extensive lists, which may lead to frustration.

### Design `Forms` as Single Columns

- Single-column forms are easier to scan and align well with mobile displays. Otherwise, multi-column forms can overwhelm users, causing them to overlook or skip fields.

### Present `Checkboxes` and `Radios` Vertically

- Vertical alignment makes checkboxes and radio buttons easier to scan. Including visuals alongside options can further enhance usability.

  ![image](./app-core/learnings/__extracted__/images/bp-ux-show-vertically.jpeg)

### Display all Options Directly if Fewer Than Six

- Show options directly when fewer than six exist. For more than five options, use a dropdown with search functionality for sets exceeding 25 items. Use a radio button group otherwise. Otherwise, dropdowns hide choices and require additional clicks to select.

  ![image](./app-core/learnings/__extracted__/images/bp-ux-show-radio-instead-selections.jpeg)

  ### Use Multi-Select Fields for Over Seven Options

- For lists with more than seven values, consider using a multi-select field to simplify the selection process.

  ![bp-ux-prefer-multiselect.webp](./app-core/learnings/__extracted__/images/bp-ux-prefer-multiselect.webp)

### Avoid Long Dropdowns

- Long dropdowns can be challenging, especially for mobile users. Limit the number of items to prevent scrolling frustration.

  ![bp-ux-avoid-long-dropdowns.webp](./app-core/learnings/__extracted__/images/bp-ux-avoid-long-dropdowns.webp)

### Appropriately Size `Modal` Windows

- Ensure modals are appropriately sized. They should not occupy the entire screen and should ideally use no more than 25% of it. If content cannot fit without scrolling, consider using a separate page instead.

### Use `Flat Buttons` on Modals

- Utilize flat buttons in modals to harmonize the button actions with dialog content.

  ![image](./app-core/learnings/__extracted__/images/bp-ux-flat-buttons-on-modals.png)

### Use `Raised` and `Ghost` Buttons

- Use raised buttons for primary actions and ghost buttons for secondary or tertiary actions.

  ![image](./app-core/learnings/__extracted__/images/bp-ux-primary-and-ghost-buttons.png)

### Provide Meaningful `Placeholder` Text

- Include placeholders to guide users on the expected input. For example, use a placeholder such as "Enter tracking number (e.g., 12345ABC)."

  ![user-experience-meaningful-placeholder](./app-core/learnings/__extracted__/images/bp-ux-user-experience-meaningful-placeholder.png)

### Add Help Icons Next to Fields

- Include a help icon ('?' or 'i') to display tooltips with guidance when hovered over. This is particularly helpful for complex or sensitive fields.

  ![user-experience-help-icon.png](./app-core/learnings/__extracted__/images/bp-ux-user-experience-help-icon.png)

### Use Toggles for Binary Choices

- For binary options (e.g., Yes/No), prefer toggles over radio buttons or dropdowns.

### Prioritize One Primary Button

- Avoid placing multiple primary buttons together. Differentiate actions using distinct button styles such as filled, outlined, or plain.

  ![bp-ux-button-variations.webp](./app-core/learnings/__extracted__/images/bp-ux-button-variations.webp)

### Use Appropriate Colors for Actions

- Apply consistent colors for actions: red for destructive actions (e.g., "Delete") and green for positive ones (e.g., "Save"). Add icons for clarity when needed.

  ![bp-ux-colored-button.webp](./app-core/learnings/__extracted__/images/bp-ux-colored-button.webp)

### Use Action-Oriented Button Labels

- Avoid vague labels like "Yes" or "No." Use clear, action-oriented text such as "Save" or "Cancel" to indicate the button's purpose.

### Eliminate Unnecessary Messages

- Avoid showing irrelevant or unclear messages that might confuse users or lead to misunderstandings.

  ![bp-ux-unneeded-message.webp](./app-core/learnings/__extracted__/images/bp-ux-unneeded-message.webp)

### Secure the `Environment`

- Ensure all software and components are up-to-date, and remove unused features or dependencies to maintain a secure environment.

### Use Prefixes for Commit Messages

- Follow a standardized convention for commit messages. Examples:

  ```shell
  docs: message
  feat: message
  fix: message
  perf: message
  refactor: message
  revert: message
  style: message
  test: message
  build: message
  ci: message
  chore: message
  ```

### Examples of Well-Written Commit Messages

- Use concise, descriptive messages. Examples: `[Component] ([Project/Module]) - [Action] [Description]`

  ```shell
  chore: update npm dependency to the latest version
  refactor(core): add and move tests for `Dispatcher`.
  fix(zone.js): store removes abort listener on the scheduled task.
  fix(docs-infra): remove config release from test scripts
  build: update io_bazel_rules_sass digest to 61dde52
  docs: resolve extra padding on the tutorial editor (#54828)
  routes (example-app) - add examples for all supported functionality
  ui (dashboard) - update styling for the new theme
  backend (auth-service) - fix token expiration issue
  API (user-profile) - remove deprecated endpoints
  docs (setup-guide) - update installation instructions
  database (orders) - optimize query performance
  middleware (security) - implement additional logging
  ```

### Code Review Guidelines

- When performing code reviews, ensure the following criteria are met:

  - **Readability:** Code should be clean and easy to understand.
  - **Performance:** Optimize for efficient execution.
  - **Reusability:** Design for modularity and future use.
  - **Test Coverage:** Include tests for edge cases and functionality.
  - **Maintainability:** Ensure code can be updated or refactored easily.

### Guidelines for Writing Issue Titles

### Use Numeric Lists in Documentation

- Use numeric lists for long content sections to improve readability and organization. Numeric lists are easier to scan than alphabetic ones.

### Using modal dialog

- Avoid relying solely on implicit methods (like clicking outside the dialog) for closing modal dialogs, as this can lead to confusion. Supporting both explicit (button + [X]) and optional implicit closing behaviors improves usability when thoughtfully applied based on context and user flow.

### Validate Content-Type

- Always validate the `Content-Type` header. Use `application/json` as the default format. Because, invalid `Content-Type` can open security risks like unwanted POST requests.

### Avoid Returning Plain Text

- Don't return plain text as an API response. While not mandatory, it's a common practice to use JSON as the data format.

### Use `camelCase` for JSON Properties

- Always use `camelCase` for JSON keys.

  **Do**:

  ```json
  {
    "userId": "1",
    "userName": "John Snow"
  }
  ```

  **Avoid**:

  ```json
  {
    "user_id": "1",
    "user_name": "John Snow"
  }
  ```

### Include Error Details in Responses

- Always include error details in the response body. Mention the affected fields if possible.

  **Example**:

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Invalid payload.",
    "detail": {
      "name": "This field is required."
    }
  }
  ```

### Include Totals in Responses

- When returning a list, include the total number of items.

  **Do**:

  ```json
  {
    "users": [{}, {}],
    "total": 2
  }
  ```

  **Avoid**:

  ```json
  {
    "users": [{}, {}]
  }
  ```

### Use Correct HTTP Methods

- Stick to standard HTTP methods for clarity:

  - **GET**: Fetch data.
  - **POST**: Create data.
  - **PUT**: Replace data.
  - **PATCH**: Update part of the data.
  - **DELETE**: Remove data.

### Return Correct Status Codes

- Match HTTP methods with appropriate status codes:

  - **200 OK**: GET, PUT, PATCH.
  - **201 Created**: POST.
  - **204 No Content**: DELETE.

### Avoid Verbs in Resource URLs

- Use HTTP methods to describe actions, not verbs in the URL.

  **Do**:
  `PUT /users/{userId}`

  **Avoid**:
  `POST /updateUser/{userId}` or `GET /getUsers`

### Use Plural Names for Collections

- Point to collections using plural names.

  **Do**:
  `GET /users`

  **Avoid**:
  `GET /user`

### URLs Should Point to Properties

- Structure URLs to start with a collection and end with an identifier.

  **Do**:
  `GET /shops/:shopId`

  **Avoid**:
  `GET /shops/:shopId/category/:categoryId/price`

### Use `kebab-case` for URLs

- Write URLs in `kebab-case` for readability.

  **Do**:
  `/system-orders`

  **Avoid**:
  `/systemOrders` or `/system_orders`

### Use `camelCase` for Parameters

- Use `camelCase` for route parameters.

  **Do**:
  `/system-orders/{orderId}`

  **Avoid**:
  `/system-orders/{order_id}` or `/system-orders/{OrderId}`

### Use Verbs for Non-Resource URLs

- For non-CRUD operations, verbs in URLs are acceptable.

  **Example**:

  ```shell
  POST /alerts/245743/resend
  ```

### Debug with `util.inspect()`

- To debug objects, use `util.inspect()` for detailed information.

  **Example**:

  ```javascript
  const util = require('util');
  console.log(
    util.inspect(object, { showHidden: false, depth: 2, colors: true })
  );
  ```

### Use `__dirname` and `path()`

- For file paths, use `__dirname` and `path()` to avoid OS inconsistencies.

  **Example**:

  ```javascript
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'views/index.html'));
  ```

## Presentations

- Keep content on slide minimal, engage the audience with interaction and an interesting demo, check mic position before and during speak, wrap up with a recap slide

## Typescript

### Avoid Mental Mapping

- When coding quickly, we often make assumptions that are clear to us in the moment but may not be easily understood by others or our future selves. Always aim to make your code as readable as possible for anyone who may encounter it.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  names.forEach((name) => {
    this.notifyUsers(name);
  });
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  names.forEach((u) => {
    this.notifyUsers(u);
  });
  ```

### Functions Should Do One Thing

- A function should focus on a single responsibility. It should have a clear, descriptive name that conveys its purpose and what the arguments represent. A function that does only one thing is easier to maintain and reuse.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  function notifyUser() {}

  function getUsers() {}

  function createFile(name) {
    fs.create(name);
  }

  function createPublicFile(name) {
    fs.create(`./public/${name}`);
  }
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  function notify() {}

  function getUsers() {}

  function createFile(name, isPublic) {
    if (isPublic) {
      fs.create(`./public/${name}`);
    } else {
      fs.create(name);
    }
  }
  ```

### Use `includes()` Instead of Multiple Conditions

- Instead of using multiple `||` conditions to check for several values, use an array and the `includes()` method. This approach is cleaner and more efficient.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  if (['orange', 'red', 'gray'].includes(x)) {
    // do something
  }
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  if (x === 'orange' || x === 'red' || x === 'gray') {
    // do something
  }
  ```

### Use Template Literals for String Concatenation

- Template literals allow you to concatenate strings and variables in a cleaner and more readable manner than using the `+` operator.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  const winnerMsg = `Congrats to the winner: ${winnerName}, you got a ${gift}`;

  const msg = `Working in conjunction with humanitarian aid agencies,
  we have supported programmes to help alleviate human suffering.`;
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  const winnerMsg =
    'Congrats to the winner: ' + winnerName + ', you got a ' + gift;

  const msg =
    'Working in conjunction with humanitarian aid agencies,\n\t' +
    'we have supported programmes to help alleviate human suffering. \n\t';
  ```

### Avoid Magic Numbers

- Magic numbers are hard-coded values without clear meaning. Always assign such numbers to a well-named variable to clarify their purpose.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  let NUMBER_OF_STUDENTS = 50;
  for (let i = 0; i < NUMBER_OF_STUDENTS; i++) {
    // do something
  }
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
    // do something
  }
  ```

### Avoid Deep Nesting

- Deeply nested loops can be difficult to understand. Instead of nesting too many levels, extract them into separate functions for clarity and reuse.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  const array = [[['John Snow']]];
  const getValuesOfNestedArray = (element) => {
    if (Array.isArray(element)) {
      return getValuesOfNestedArray(element[0]);
    }
    return element;
  };
  getValuesOfNestedArray(array);
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  const array = [[['John Snow']]];
  array.forEach((firstArr) => {
    firstArr.forEach((secondArr) => {
      secondArr.forEach((element) => {
        console.log(element);
      });
    });
  });
  ```

### Avoid Large Functions

- Large functions can be overwhelming and hard to maintain. Break them down into smaller, focused functions to enhance readability, reusability, and testability.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  // add
  const add = (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
  };
  // sub
  const sub = (a, b) => {
    return a - b;
  };
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  const addSub = (a, b) => {
    // add
    const addition = a + b;
    // sub
    const sub = a - b;
    // returning as a string
    return `${addition}${sub}`;
  };
  ```

### Favor Descriptive Over Concise Naming

- Always use descriptive names for functions, variables, and constants. This avoids ambiguity and improves code readability, especially when there are multiple similar functions.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  const searchUserByPhoneNo = (phone) => {
    // do something
  };
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  const searchUser = (phone) => {
    // do something
  };
  ```

### Avoid Contractions

- Avoid using contractions in variable and function names as they reduce readability.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  const onItemClick = () => {};
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  const onItmClk = () => {};
  ```

### Capitalize Constant Values (SNAKE CASE)

- Constant values should be in uppercase with words separated by underscores. This is a widely accepted convention to differentiate constants from regular variables.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  const DAYS_IN_A_YEAR = 365;
  ```

### Avoid Inlining Function Types

- Instead of inlining function types directly within the function signature, define them separately for clarity and better maintainability.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  type SearchParams = {
    title?: string;
    publishYear?: string;
    author?: string;
  };

  type Book = {
    isbn: string;
    title: string;
    publishYear: string;
    author: string[];
  };

  type GetBooks = (s: SearchParams) => Promise<Book[]>;

  const getBooks: GetBooks = (searchParams) =>
    fetch(api + createQuery(searchParams)).then((res) =>
      res.ok ? res.json() : Promise.reject(res)
    );
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  const getBooks = (searchParams: {
    title?: string;
    publishYear?: string;
    author?: string;
  }): Promise<{
    isbn: string;
    title: string;
    publishYear: string;
    author: string[];
  }>[] => {
    return fetch(api + createQuery(searchParams)).then((res) =>
      res.ok ? res.json() : Promise.reject(res)
    );
  };
  ```

### Use Strong Type Checks

- Always use `===` (strict equality) instead of `==` (loose equality) to avoid unexpected type coercion.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  if (val === '123') {
    console.log(val);
  }
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  if (val == 123) {
    console.log(val);
  }
  ```

### Use Proper Variable Naming

- Variables should be named clearly to convey their purpose. Avoid unnecessary words or context in variable names.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  const MAX_AGE = 30;
  let daysSinceLastVisit = 10;

  let currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
  const isUserOlderThanAllowed = user.age > MAX_AGE;
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  let daysSLV = 10;
  let y = new Date().getFullYear();

  let ok;
  if (user.age > 30) {
    ok = true;
  }
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  let name;
  let product;
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  let nameValue;
  let theProduct;
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  const product = {
    id: 1,
    name: 'T-Shirt',
    price: 8.99,
    units: 12,
  };
  product.name;
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  const product = {
    productId: 1,
    productName: 'T-Shirt',
    productPrice: 8.99,
    productUnits: 12,
  };
  product.productName;
  ```

### Use Long Names for Long Scopes

- Short variable names are fine for small scopes. Use descriptive, longer names for variables in larger scopes.

  **Do:**

  ```typescript
  function calculateInvoiceTotal(items: Item[]): number {
    let totalAmountForAllItems = 0; // Descriptive variable name for long scope
    for (let item of items) {
      totalAmountForAllItems += item.price * item.quantity;
    }
    return totalAmountForAllItems;
  }
  ```

  **Avoid:**

  ```typescript
  function calculateInvoiceTotal(items: Item[]): number {
    let t = 0; // Short variable name in a long scope
    for (let i of items) {
      t += i.price * i.quantity;
    }
    return t;
  }
  ```

### Function Names Should Describe Side Effects

- Function, variable, and class names should clearly indicate their purpose and behavior. Example: A function named `createOrReturns` explicitly describes its dual behavior.

  **Do:**

  ```typescript
  import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

  const userId = uuidv4(); // Random GUID
  ```

  **Avoid:**

  ```typescript
  let userId = 1; // Sequential ID (Not recommended)
  ```

### Use Proper Function Naming

- Function names should be long and descriptive, reflecting their behavior and the intent of the arguments. Avoid excessive arguments (ideally no more than two) to keep the function simple and testable. Default arguments should be used instead of conditionals where possible.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  function sendEmailUser(emailAddress) {
    // implementation
  }
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  function email(user) {
    // implementation
  }
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  function getProducts({ fields, fromDate, toDate }) {
    // implementation
  }

  getProducts({
    fields: ['id', 'name', 'price', 'units'],
    fromDate: '2020-07-01',
    toDate: '2020-07-22',
  });
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  function getProducts(fields, fromDate, toDate) {
    // implementation
  }
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  function createShape(type = 'circle') {
    // ...
  }
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  function createShape(type) {
    const shapeType = type || 'circle';
    // ...
  }
  ```

### Use `scan` instead of `reduce` operator

- Use `scan` instead of `reduce` for streams, as it emits an intermediate result at each step, making it more useful for real-time processing.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  const source$ = range(0, 10);

  source$
    .pipe(
      filter((x) => x % 2 === 0),
      map((x) => x + x),
      scan((acc, x) => acc + x, 0)
    )
    .subscribe((x) => console.log(x));
  ```

### Place Most of the Code Outside the Conditional Branch

- Avoid placing too much logic inside conditional branches. This can make the code difficult to follow. Instead, execute the main logic outside the condition and return early if necessary.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  function drawRectangle(e) {
    const mouseOutOfBounds = this.getMousePos(e);
    if (mouseOutOfBounds) {
      return;
    }

    const ctx = this.canvas.getContext('2d');
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.lineWidth = '4';
    ctx.strokeStyle = 'green';
    ctx.rect(30, 30, 50, 50);
    ctx.stroke();
  }
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  function drawRectangle(e) {
    const mouseOutOfBounds = this.getMousePos(e);
    if (!mouseOutOfBounds) {
      const ctx = this.canvas.getContext('2d');
      ctx.beginPath();
      ctx.lineWidth = '4';
      ctx.strokeStyle = 'green';
      ctx.rect(30, 30, 50, 50);
      ctx.stroke();
    }
  }
  ```

### Use `Early Return` pattern

- Using the early return pattern makes code more readable and efficient by eliminating unnecessary `else` statements.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  function FizzBuzz(i) {
    if (i % 15 === 0) {
      return 'FizzBuzz';
    }
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
      return 'Fizz';
    }
    return i % 5 === 0 ? 'Buzz' : i;
  }
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  function FizzBuzz(i) {
    let result = undefined;
    if (i % 15 === 0) {
      result = 'FizzBuzz';
    } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
      result = 'Fizz';
    } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
      result = 'Buzz';
    } else {
      result = i;
    }
    return result;
  }
  ```

### Avoid Implicit `else` Block

- Explicitly handle all cases to enhance readability and adhere to the fail-fast principle.

  **Prefer**:

  ```typescript
  function carBrand(model) {
    if (model === 'A4') {
      return 'Audi';
    }
    if (model === 'AMG') {
      return 'Mercedes-Benz';
    }
    throw new Error('Model not found');
  }
  ```

  **Avoid**:

  ```typescript
  function carBrand(model) {
    if (model === 'A4') {
      return 'Audi';
    }
    return 'Mercedes-Benz';
  }
  ```

### Use Optional Chaining

- Optional chaining (`?.`) helps prevent runtime errors when accessing deeply nested properties in objects that may not exist.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  const value = data?.test?.value;
  console.log(value);

  const person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 19,
    fullName() {
      return 'John Snow';
    },
  };

  person.lastName?.(); // undefined (no error)
  person.fullName?.(); // John Snow
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  const data = { test: { value: 1 } };
  if (data && data.test) {
    console.log(data.test.value);
  }
  ```

### Use Nullish Coalescing

- Use the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to handle cases where a value is `null` or `undefined`. It ensures that only those values are replaced by the right-hand side, unlike `||` which also replaces falsy values like `0` or `''`.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  let maybeValue = '';
  let safeValue = maybeValue ?? 'value';
  console.log(safeValue); // ""

  maybeValue = null;
  let safeValue = maybeValue ?? 'value';
  console.log(safeValue); // "value"

  const authorName = book?.author?.firstName ?? 'Unknown';
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  let maybeValue = 'I exist';
  let safeValue = maybeValue || 'value';
  console.log(safeValue); // "I exist"
  ```

### Passing `arguments` as `objects`

- Passing arguments as objects improves code readability, as it eliminates the need for the arguments to be in a specific order and helps with autocompletion in IDEs.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  const createProduct = ({ name, description, price }) => {
    // Create the product
  };

  createProduct({
    name: 'Pepperoni Pizza',
    description: 'Hot, crispy and tasty!',
    price: 15.99,
  });
  ```

### Use `named` Parameters Instead of `options` Objects

- Named parameters improve the clarity of function calls by explicitly showing which options are being passed.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  function setPageThread(name, { popular, expires, activeClass } = {}) {
    console.log(popular);
    console.log(expires);
    console.log(activeClass);
  }
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  function setPageThread(name, options = {}) {
    let popular = options.popular;
    let expires = options.expires;
    let activeClass = options.activeClass;
  }
  ```

### Use `Object.entries()` to Check Empty Object

- To check if an object is empty, use `Object.entries()` which returns an array of the object's enumerable properties. If the length is 0, the object is empty.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  let sampleObj = {
    name: 'Mark',
    occupation: 'Developer',
  };
  let emptyObj = {};
  console.log(Object.entries(sampleObj).length === 0); // false
  console.log(Object.entries(emptyObj).length === 0); // true
  ```

### Use `dot` Syntax Over `bracket` Syntax

- We should prefer `dot` syntax when the properties are known in advance, as it makes the code more succinct and easier to read. Use `bracket` syntax only when the property is a variable or might change dynamically.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  book.preface.intro = 'Section 1';
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  book['preface']['intro'] = 'Section 1';
  ```

### Use `spread` Operator to Conditionally Add Properties to Objects or Arrays

- The `spread` operator (`...`) allows for quick and conditional additions of properties to objects or arrays.

  **Example**:

  ```typescript
  const condition = true;
  const person = {
    id: 1,
    name: 'John Doe',
    ...(condition && { age: 16 }),
  };
  ```

  ```javascript
  const fruits = ['a', 'b', ...(isSummer ? ['w'] : [])];
  ```

### Use `in` Keyword to Check if Property Exists in an Object

- The `in` keyword is the preferred way to check if a property exists in an object.

  **Example**:

  ```typescript
  const person = { name: 'John Doe', salary: 1000 };
  console.log('salary' in person); // returns true
  console.log('age' in person); // returns false
  ```

### Use `multiline` Comments Over `single-line` Comments for Long Text

- For long comments, use multiline comments for better readability.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  /*
  This is another long comment
  written as a multiline comment
  */
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  // This is a long comment
  // Which is written as multiple single-line comments.
  ```

### Use `Union Types` Instead of `Enum`

- Union types are preferred over `enum` because they offer more flexibility, don't get compiled, and are more linear. If you must use `enum`, declare it as `const` to prevent it from being included in the build output. Also, Enums cannot be tree-shaken.

  **Code Example** - `Do` (Union Types):

  ```typescript
  export type GamePadInput = 'UP' | 'DOWN' | 'LEFT' | 'RIGHT';
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Do` (Const Enum)

  ```typescript
  const enum ProductType {
    Sports,
    HomeGoods,
    Groceries,
  }
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid` (Enum)

  ```typescript
  enum GamePadInput {
    Up = 'UP',
    Down = 'DOWN',
    Left = 'LEFT',
    Right = 'RIGHT',
  }
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  export const HttpStatusCode_OK = 200;
  export const HttpStatusCode_BAD_REQUEST = 400;
  export const HttpStatusCode_UNAUTHORIZED = 401;
  export const HttpStatusCode_FORBIDDEN = 403;
  export const HttpStatusCode_NOT_FOUND = 404;
  export const HttpStatusCode_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR = 500;

  export const ALL_HTTP_STATUS_CODES = [
    HttpStatusCode_OK,
    HttpStatusCode_BAD_REQUEST,
    HttpStatusCode_UNAUTHORIZED,
    HttpStatusCode_FORBIDDEN,
    HttpStatusCode_NOT_FOUND,
    HttpStatusCode_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
  ] as const;

  export type HttpStatusCodes = (typeof ALL_HTTP_STATUS_CODES)[number];
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  export enum HttpStatusCode {
    OK = 200,
    BAD_REQUEST = 400,
    UNAUTHORIZED = 401,
    FORBIDDEN = 403,
    NOT_FOUND = 404,
    INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR = 500,
  }
  ```

### Avoid Code Duplication

- Duplicate code increases maintenance complexity. Instead, abstract common logic into reusable functions.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  function showEmployeeList(employees) {
    employees.forEach((employee) => {
      const expectedSalary = employee.calculateExpectedSalary();
      const experience = employee.getExperience();

      const data = {
        expectedSalary,
        experience,
      };

      switch (employee.type) {
        case 'manager':
          data.portfolio = employee.getMBAProjects();
          break;
        case 'developer':
          data.githubLink = employee.getGithubLink();
          break;
      }

      render(data);
    });
  }
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  function showDeveloperList(developers) {
    developers.forEach((developer) => {
      const expectedSalary = developer.calculateExpectedSalary();
      const experience = developer.getExperience();
      const githubLink = developer.getGithubLink();
      const data = {
        expectedSalary,
        experience,
        githubLink,
      };

      render(data);
    });
  }

  function showManagerList(managers) {
    managers.forEach((manager) => {
      const expectedSalary = manager.calculateExpectedSalary();
      const experience = manager.getExperience();
      const portfolio = manager.getMBAProjects();
      const data = {
        expectedSalary,
        experience,
        portfolio,
      };

      render(data);
    });
  }
  ```

### Avoid Using Flags as Function Parameters

- Functions should focus on one thing. Avoid using flags to make a function do multiple tasks. Instead, split the function into multiple functions.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  function createFile(name) {
    fs.create(name);
  }

  function createTempFile(name) {
    createFile(`./temp/${name}`);
  }
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  function createFile(name, temp) {
    if (temp) {
      fs.create(`./temp/${name}`);
    } else {
      fs.create(name);
    }
  }
  ```

### Avoid Positional Markers

- Positional markers add noise to the code. Let functions and variable names, along with proper indentation, convey the structure of your code.

  **Code Example** - `Do`

  ```typescript
  $scope.model = {
    menu: 'foo',
    nav: 'bar',
  };

  const actions = function () {
    // ...
  };
  ```

  **Code Example** - `Avoid`

  ```typescript
  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  // Scope Model Instantiation
  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  $scope.model = {
    menu: 'foo',
    nav: 'bar',
  };

  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  // Action setup
  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  const actions = function () {
    // ...
  };
  ```

### Avoid Direct Use of `Object.prototype` Methods

- Avoid directly calling `Object.prototype` methods like `hasOwnProperty`, `propertyIsEnumerable`, and `isPrototypeOf`. These methods can be shadowed by properties in the object or fail with objects created without a prototype (e.g., `Object.create(null)`). Use the `call` method to ensure functionality.

  **Example**:

  ```typescript
  const obj = { a: 1 };
  const hasA = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, 'a');
  ```

### Prefer Type Annotations Over Type Assertions

- Using type annotations ensures type safety and compile-time checks.

  **Prefer**:

  ```typescript
  const william: Person = {
    name: 'William',
    age: 25,
    occupation: 'artist',
  };
  ```

  **Avoid**:

  ```typescript
  const william = {
    name: 'William',
    age: 25,
  } as Person;
  ```

### Avoid `++` Operator; Use Compound Operators

- Instead of incrementing with `++`, use compound operators like `+=`.

### Avoid Assigning `undefined`

- Do not manually assign `undefined` to variables. Use `null` instead when needed.

### Encapsulate Complex Conditions into Functions

- Encapsulate complex conditional logic into functions with descriptive names to enhance readability.

  **Prefer**:

  ```typescript
  function shouldShowSpinner(fsm, listNode) {
    return fsm.state === 'fetching' && isEmpty(listNode);
  }

  if (shouldShowSpinner(fsmInstance, listNodeInstance)) {
    // ...
  }
  ```

  **Avoid**:

  ```typescript
  if (fsm.state === 'fetching' && isEmpty(listNode)) {
    // ...
  }
  ```

### Handle Caught Errors

- Always handle caught errors meaningfully. Logging to the console is insufficient.

  **Prefer**:

  ```typescript
  try {
    functionThatMightThrow();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    notifyUserOfError(error);
    reportErrorToService(error);
  }
  ```

  **Avoid**:

  ```typescript
  try {
    functionThatMightThrow();
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
  ```

### Provide Context with Exceptions

- Include detailed context in error messages to identify the source and nature of the problem.
- Always pass meaningful messages with exceptions.

  **Do:**

  ```typescript
  throw new Error(
    `User not found with ID: ${userId}. Ensure the ID is correct.`
  );
  ```

  **Avoid:**

  ```typescript
  throw new Error('User not found.');
  ```

### Prefer Exceptions Over Error Codes

- Returning error codes forces the caller to handle errors immediately.
- Using exceptions allows error handling to be separate from the primary logic, simplifying the code.

  **Do:**

  ```typescript
  class UserService {
    getUserById(userId: number): User {
      if (!this.isValidUser(userId)) {
        throw new Error(`Invalid user ID: ${userId}`);
      }
      // Logic to retrieve user
      return new User(userId);
    }
  }

  try {
    const user = new UserService().getUserById(123);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  }
  ```

  **Avoid:**

  ```typescript
  class UserService {
    getUserById(userId: number): number {
      if (!this.isValidUser(userId)) {
        return -1; // Error code
      }
      // Logic to retrieve user
      return 0; // Success code
    }
  }

  const result = new UserService().getUserById(123);
  if (result === -1) {
    console.error('Invalid user ID.');
  }
  ```

### Handle Rejected `promises` or `observables`

- Similar to caught errors, rejected promises should be handled properly.

  **Prefer**:

  ```typescript
  getData()
    .then((data) => functionThatMightThrow(data))
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
      notifyUserOfError(error);
      reportErrorToService(error);
    });
  ```

  **Avoid**:

  ```typescript
  getData()
    .then((data) => functionThatMightThrow(data))
    .catch((error) => console.log(error));
  ```

### Use Logical Nullish Assignment (`??=`)

- The `??=` operator assigns a value only if the variable is nullish (null or undefined).

  **Prefer**:

  ```typescript
  let user = { name: 'John Snow' };
  user.twitterName ??= '@john_snow';
  ```

  **Avoid**:

  ```typescript
  if (!user.twitterName) {
    user.twitterName = '@john_snow';
  }
  ```

### Prefer ECMAScript `#field` for Private Members

- Use `#field` instead of `private` for private class members, as it is natively supported in JavaScript.

  **Prefer**:

  ```typescript
  class Test {
    #age: number;
  }
  ```

  **Avoid**:

  ```typescript
  class Test {
    private age: number;
  }
  ```

### Use `at()` Method for Array/String Access

- The `at()` method simplifies accessing elements from the end of an array or string.

  **Example**:

  ```typescript
  const A = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
  A.at(-1); // 10

  const S = 'Hello World';
  S.at(-1); // 'd'
  ```

### Use `findLast()` to Locate Items from the End

- The `findLast()` method helps locate array items starting from the end.

  **Example**:

  ```typescript
  const A = [1, 20, 3, 40, 5];
  A.findLast((v) => v % 10 === 0); // 40
  ```

### Use `hasOwn()` Instead of `hasOwnProperty()`

- The `Object.hasOwn()` method is more concise and avoids issues with shadowing.

  **Prefer**:

  ```typescript
  if (Object.hasOwn(object, 'foo')) {
    console.log('has property foo');
  }
  ```

  **Avoid**:

  ```typescript
  let hasOwnProperty = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;
  if (hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'foo')) {
    console.log('has property foo');
  }
  ```

### Use the `cause` Property in Errors

- Preserve the original error when wrapping errors using the `cause` property.

  **Example**:

  ```typescript
  await fetch('https://example.com/data.csv')
    .catch((err) => {
      throw new Error('Failed to fetch', { cause: err });
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.log('Cause:', err.cause);
    });
  ```

### Use Descriptive Names for Generics

- Use descriptive names for generics to improve clarity.

  **Prefer**:

  ```typescript
  function head<Element>(arr: Element[]): Element | undefined {
    return arr[0];
  }
  ```

  **Avoid**:

  ```typescript
  function head<T>(arr: T[]): T | undefined {
    return arr[0];
  }
  ```

### Class Names Should be Meaningful

- Use **noun** or **noun phrase** names for classes, such as `Customer`, `WikiPage`, `Account`, or `AddressParser`. Avoid using terms like `Manager`, `Processor`, `Data`, or `Info`. A class name should not be a verb.

  **Do:**

  ```typescript
  class Customer {
    private name: string;
    private email: string;

    constructor(name: string, email: string) {
      this.name = name;
      this.email = email;
    }

    updateContactInfo(email: string): void {
      this.email = email;
    }
  }
  ```

  **Avoid:**

  ```typescript
  class CustomerManager {
    private name: string;
    private email: string;

    constructor(name: string, email: string) {
      this.name = name;
      this.email = email;
    }

    manageCustomerDetails(email: string): void {
      this.email = email;
    }
  }
  ```

### Method Names Should be Meaningful

- Methods should have **verb** or **verb phrase** names, such as `postPayment`, `deletePage`, or `save`.

  **Do:**

  ```typescript
  class Account {
    postPayment(amount: number): void {
      // logic to post payment
    }

    deletePage(pageId: number): void {
      // logic to delete a page
    }
  }
  ```

  **Avoid:**

  ```typescript
  class Account {
    paymentHandler(amount: number): void {
      // logic to post payment
    }

    pageRemoval(pageId: number): void {
      // logic to delete a page
    }
  }
  ```

### Pick One Word Per Concept

- Maintain consistency by using one word for a single concept throughout the codebase. For example:

- Avoid mixing terms like `fetch`, `retrieve`, and `get` for similar actions.
- Do not use varied terms like `controller`, `manager`, or `driver` interchangeably. A consistent lexicon simplifies understanding and usage.

  **Do:**

  ```typescript
  class DataFetcher {
    fetchData(): string {
      return 'data';
    }
  }
  ```

  **Avoid:**

  ```typescript
  class DataRetriever {
    getData(): string {
      return 'data';
    }
  }
  ```

### Blocks and Indenting

- Code blocks (e.g., `if`, `else`, `while`) should typically contain one line of code, ideally a function call.
- Keep function indentation shallow (one or two levels) for better readability and maintainability.
- Smaller, focused functions are easier to name descriptively and understand.

  **Do:**

  ```typescript
  if (isEligible(user)) {
    grantAccess(user);
  }
  ```

  **Avoid:**

  ```typescript
  if (isEligible(user)) {
    // Check for additional eligibility
    if (!user.isBlacklisted) {
      // Log the event
      console.log('Access granted to user');
      grantAccess(user);
    }
  }
  ```

### Command-Query Separation

- A function should either, It should not do both:

  1. Perform an action (change the state of an object).
  1. Return information about an object.

     **Do:**

  ```typescript
  isEligibleForUpgrade(): boolean {
      // Check if user is eligible
      return true;
  }

  upgradeAccount(): void {
      // Perform account upgrade
  }
  ```

  **Avoid:**

  ```typescript
  checkAndUpgradeAccount(): boolean {
      if (this.isEligibleForUpgrade()) {
          this.upgradeAccount();
          return true;
      }
      return false;
  }
  ```

### Avoid Javadoc in Non-Public Code

- Javadoc are useful for public APIs but unnecessary for internal or non-public code.

  **Do:**

  ```typescript
  class InternalHelper {
    // This method calculates the sum of two numbers.
    add(a: number, b: number): number {
      return a + b;
    }
  }
  ```

  **Avoid:**

  ```typescript
  /**
   * This method calculates the sum of two numbers.
   */
  class InternalHelper {
    add(a: number, b: number): number {
      return a + b;
    }
  }
  ```

### Vertical Density

- Place lines of code that are closely related together to improve readability.

### Horizontal Openness and Density

- Avoid spaces between function names and opening parentheses, as the function and its arguments are closely related.

### Vertical Openness Between Concepts

- Use blank lines to separate distinct concepts, making the code easier to navigate.

  **Do:**

  ```typescript
  class User {
    constructor(private name: string, private age: number) {}

    getDetails(): string {
      return `${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}`;
    }
  }

  class UserService {
    getAllUsers(): User[] {
      return [new User('Alice', 25), new User('Bob', 30)];
    }
  }
  ```

  **Avoid:**

  ```typescript
  class User {
    constructor(private name: string, private age: number) {}
    getDetails(): string {
      return `${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}`;
    }
  }
  class UserService {
    getAllUsers(): User[] {
      return [new User('Alice', 25), new User('Bob', 30)];
    }
  }
  ```

### Don't Return `null`

- Returning `null` can lead to unexpected errors.
- Instead, throw an exception or return a special-case object.
- For third-party APIs that return `null`, wrap such methods to handle this explicitly.

  **Do:**

  ```typescript
  class UserService {
    getUserById(userId: number): User {
      if (!this.isValidUser(userId)) {
        throw new Error(`User not found with ID: ${userId}`);
      }
      return new User(userId);
    }
  }
  ```

  **Avoid:**

  ```typescript
  class UserService {
    getUserById(userId: number): User | null {
      if (!this.isValidUser(userId)) {
        return null;
      }
      return new User(userId);
    }
  }
  ```

### Don't Pass `null`

- Passing `null` to methods is worse than returning `null`. Avoid it unless explicitly required by an external API.

  **Do:**

  ```typescript
  class NotificationService {
    sendNotification(user: User): void {
      if (!user) {
        throw new Error('Invalid user object provided.');
      }
      // Logic to send notification
    }
  }

  const user = new User(123);
  new NotificationService().sendNotification(user);
  ```

  **Avoid:**

  ```typescript
  class NotificationService {
    sendNotification(user: User | null): void {
      if (user === null) {
        console.error('Cannot send notification to a null user.');
        return;
      }
      // Logic to send notification
    }
  }

  new NotificationService().sendNotification(null);
  ```

### Follow FIRST Rule for Clean Tests

- **Fast**: Tests should execute quickly.
- **Independent**: Tests should not depend on each other.
- **Repeatable**: Tests should work in any environment.
- **Self-validating**: Tests should yield a boolean result (pass/fail).
- **Timely**: Write tests early during development.

### Keep Design Simple

- A "simple" design should passes all tests, avoids duplication, clearly expresses intent and minimizes the number of classes and methods.

  **Do:**

  ```typescript
  class Calculator {
    add(a: number, b: number): number {
      return a + b;
    }

    subtract(a: number, b: number): number {
      return a - b;
    }
  }
  ```

  **Avoid:**

  ```typescript
  class Calculator {
    performOperation(operation: string, a: number, b: number): number {
      if (operation === 'add') {
        return a + b;
      } else if (operation === 'subtract') {
        return a - b;
      }
      return 0;
    }
  }
  ```

### Avoid Overloading Interfaces

- Tight, small interfaces reduce coupling. Avoid defining interfaces with too many functions to depend on.

  **Do:**

  ```typescript
  interface IAdder {
    add(a: number, b: number): number;
  }

  interface ISubtractor {
    subtract(a: number, b: number): number;
  }
  ```

  **Avoid:**

  ```typescript
  interface ICalculator {
    add(a: number, b: number): number;
    subtract(a: number, b: number): number;
    multiply(a: number, b: number): number;
    divide(a: number, b: number): number;
  }
  ```

### Prefer Polymorphism Over Conditional Statements

- Where applicable, use polymorphism instead of `if/else` or `switch/case`.

  **Do:**

  ```typescript
  abstract class Shape {
    abstract area(): number;
  }

  class Circle extends Shape {
    constructor(private radius: number) {
      super();
    }

    area(): number {
      return Math.PI * this.radius ** 2;
    }
  }

  class Rectangle extends Shape {
    constructor(private width: number, private height: number) {
      super();
    }

    area(): number {
      return this.width * this.height;
    }
  }
  ```

  **Avoid:**

  ```typescript
  function calculateArea(shape: string, dimensions: any): number {
    if (shape === 'circle') {
      return Math.PI * dimensions.radius ** 2;
    } else if (shape === 'rectangle') {
      return dimensions.width * dimensions.height;
    }
    return 0;
  }
  ```

### Use Random IDs Instead of Sequential

- Adopt `GUIDs` as random ID generators instead of sequential IDs to prevent Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) vulnerabilities.

  **Do:**

  ```typescript
  import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

  const userId = uuidv4(); // Random GUID
  ```

  **Avoid:**

  ```typescript
  let userId = 1; // Sequential ID (Not recommended)
  ```
