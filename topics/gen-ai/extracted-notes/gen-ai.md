# Extracted Notes - Generative AI

## Stable Diffusion

- Stable diffusion is a latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating photo realistic images given any text input. The model employs a technique called diffusion modelling, which works by incrementally reducing the noise in a sample over several iterations, eventually producing a final output. Diffusion model is a type of model that generates a chain of increasingly noisy images by adding Gaussian noise to an image and then training a model to predict the noise added to an image from one step to following one. It uses a fixed and finite number of steps to generate images, resulting in a stable repeatable image generation.

## LLM

- Local LLMs are advanced AI models that have been optimized to run on personal devices without the need for constant internet connectivity like GPT-2 Mobile, ALBERT, DistilBERT.

## Misc

- Companies that embraced AI too eagerly have to had to contend with frustrated customers and declining service quality.

- If AI is going to speak for me, it needs to ask more than just permission... it needs to know when to step. Because being helpful doesn't give it the right become me.

- Generative ai is just brain can't take any action, but agentic ai is like also having body parts which can take action and have goals, planning, memory, reasoning, autonomy.

- GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke has also outlined four stages of evolution of developers in the AI era:
  - AI Skeptic – Dabbling with code completions and basic prompts.
  - AI Explorer – Using AI for debugging and boilerplate generation
  - AI Collaborator – Co-creating with AI across multi-step tasks
  - AI Strategist – Delegating and verifying complex implementations with multi-agent workflows

- Jobs Most At Risk (High AI Applicability) - AI tackles a lot of repetitive, communication-heavy, or content-focused tasks, making roles like these particularly vulnerable: Interpreters & translators, Historians, Flight attendants/passenger attendants, Writers, authors, and editors, Customer service reps and call operators, Sales agents and PR professionals, Radio DJs and broadcast announcers

- Jobs Less Vulnerable (Low AI Applicability) Roles requiring physical presence, manual labor, emotion, or nuanced human judgment remain safer: Phlebotomists, nursing assistants, massage therapists, Roofers, construction laborers, cement finishers, Various machinery operators (dredge, logging equipment, water treatment), Embalmers, bridge/lock tenders, dishwasher staff, cleaning roles, Data scientists and technical analysts

- Focus on uniquely human skills: Critical thinking, creativity, emotional intelligence, and adaptability still matter. Stay ahead through learning: Build AI literacy, sharpen prompt-writing skills, and understand AI’s limits—none of these alone guarantee job security, but they do offer a competitive edge.
