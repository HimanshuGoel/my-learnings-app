SDE-2 at Airtel Digital | Full-Stack Developer (Java + Angular) | Building Scalable Systems in Fintech

👋 I’m a Full-Stack Software Engineer with 4+ years of experience building stable, high-impact systems in the fintech and core banking space.

I’ve worked on critical billing and pricing platforms used by European banks, with hands-on experience across backend (Java, Spring Boot), frontend (Angular), and infrastructure (CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes). I care about writing clean, scalable code, building reliable systems, and making sure what I build actually works — in production, under pressure.

I thrive in cross-functional teams, enjoy solving complex problems, and take pride in seeing projects through from idea to delivery.

Always open to interesting conversations, product ideas, and opportunities to build meaningful systems.
