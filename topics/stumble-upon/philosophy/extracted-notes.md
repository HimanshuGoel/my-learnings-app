- What makes life enjoyable to live - A loaded bank account, a healthy relationship & a comfortable life is what most people will like to have, but it's not enough to live only, you must be determined to live for something.

- Remember that friends episode where Chandler and Monica are having an argument and Chandler says that when women are nice to a man they automatically assume that you like them. And then Ross agrees. I don't think people realize how true that is. Try not to make conversation with people you don't know. Especially if you are a young woman. If someone talks to you reply in one word answers which would show them that you are not interested in conversations with them.
