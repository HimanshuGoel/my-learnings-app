# Extracted Notes - Java

## Java

- Java is a blueprint for a building, specifying every detail. The blueprint (bytecode) is then interpreted by a skilled builder (JVM) to construct the building (application) on any plot of land (platform). JS, on the other hand is like flexible LEGO bricks. You can build various structures (web features) on the fly, without a rigid plan.
