# Technical

- Trajectory over raw speed. It's not just about doing a lot; it's about doing meaningful things that steer things forward.

poor people watch lot of tv, eat fast food, buy things which are sale (we should only buy stock which are on sale), they are in sports watching (not themself as atheletes), don't shower ofetn as rich people do, blame others for their misfortunes, tend to have more kids and earlier in their life, do not do regular checks with their doctor, spend money before they get it, surround themself with poor people, belive that others should help them reach the top

Frontend vs Backend vs Full-stack vs DevOps – what should you choose?
How I would become a software architect in 3 years (if I were in college again)
How to use AI (ChatGPT/GitHub Copilot) as a dev, not as a cheater
System Design for Beginners (using real-life examples)
How AI is changing software development
Rate this website’s UX (live user experience roast)
Life of a Software Engineer (Reality vs College Life)
How Real Projects Are Built in Industry
Gen Z vs Millennials in tech: who wins and why?
Why design is more powerful than code
Ugly vs Beautiful websites – can you spot the difference?
Why frontend is now more complex than backend

>A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street.  ~Doug Linder

>What a nice saying in the movie 'THE TOWN' - No matter how much you change.....you still have to pay the price for the things you've done. So l got a long road.But l know I'll see you again....This side or the other.

>it is really time to make our planet smart... and one day i want to be in IBM... so from now i m doing my best here to get there..

>To learn additional skills so that he can do some enhancement or maintain automation pipeline using docker , kubernetes,
ci‐cd etc. To take a step back ‐ get bigger picture of the application and think about end to end solution.

>avoid putting sizzling hot things in mouth, big no for tea and soft drinks, didn't built habit of putting pins to remove lodged food, never use my front teeth as a lid opener

>nerds room details - aditya pandey – founder, vrishti kumari – content creator, hardik talwar – event manager, yugank prajapati – event manager, dhairya gupta – college chapter lead

:always keep your illness a secret
:don't tell anyone directly how much you earn or how much money you have
:don't wait for the ambulance, use the car instead to go hospital when someone is sick

>The “sweet spot” for employers is narrowing: they want mid-career people (early 30s) who are cheaper than veterans, but already productive. Meanwhile younger candidates are seen as too costly to train and older ones as too expensive or hard to reskill. The rise of automation and AI is further changing expectations: tasks entry-level people used to do are now being displaced or redefined.

What senior reviewers focus on
Understanding the why behind changes: check the ticket or requirement first to see the intent, not just the code diffs.
Functionality & correctness: Does the code meet its purpose? Does it properly handle edge cases, error conditions, and unexpected inputs?
Readability and maintainability: Clear naming, modular functions, avoiding complexity. If someone else is handed this code next month, can they understand and build on it?
Performance & scalability: Are there obvious performance pitfalls (e.g., nested loops, repeated database calls) or maintainability issues that will cause trouble as code evolves?
Security & best practices: Are secrets hardcoded? Is input validated? Is the code aligned with organizational or language style guides?
Test coverage & quality: Are there appropriate tests (unit/integration)? Do tests cover edge cases, not just happy paths?
Collaboration mindset: Provide actionable feedback (not just “bad code”), highlight good things, maintain respectful tone. Code review is about improving the team’s output, not just pointing out flaws.

Common mistakes or pitfalls senior reviewers avoid
Focusing only on nit-picky style issues and missing the broader problem (architecture, maintainability).
Making the review personal (“you did this wrong”) rather than focusing on the code and the change. (As one source puts it: “Critique the code, not the author.”)
Software Engineering Stack Exchange
Overwhelming the author with too many comments at once, especially minor things overshadowing bigger issues. Good reviewers prioritise what matters most.
Skipping reading the context of the change (why, how, what assumptions) and just reviewing the diff superficially.

Writing best practices

>details - writing
:journal - monday to friday - new features, issues, interaction with colleague, morning runs for fitness, talking with friends or parents, saturday and sunday - attended any get together, new place, food outlet, etc.
:mall review - shopping, spacious, well-designed, and easy to navigate, variety of stores, food court, restrooms, staff, parking
:resort review - rooms were spacious, clean, bed was incredibly comfortable, staff were courteous with a smile, located, breakfast buffet, facilities
:heritage sites - site is well-preserved and offers stunning views, guided tour, informational signs and displays, facilities were well-maintained, spots to rest, gift shop offered a nice selection of souvenirs, staff
:restaurant review - food quality, specific dish, presented, service, waiter was friendly and attentive, ambiance, background music, restaurant was clean and well-maintained including the restrooms, prices, portion sizes, menu variety, wait time for seat and food, location with parking space

"Never disrupt user habits unless absolutely necessary, that's a core UX principle"
There is a reason BMW, Audi, VW etc make successful cars. They do incremental changes, and ensure that when you sit in your new BMW there is enough familiarity with your current one. The same for mobile phones.
