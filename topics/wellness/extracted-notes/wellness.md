## Soft Skills

### LinkedIn

- LinkedIn - A place to find and be found. Profile pic should be a head shot with proper background color.

### Writing

- 5 parts of formula for more effective message – don't have the long paragraph. Next step is phone call, over the email, or face to face meeting.

- Key elements of a email – subject, introduction, the message, call to action (last part of the body), email signature.

- We should avoid using BCC feature, but we can use it to hide addresses from the recipients. If you are BCC recipients then you should not reply to that email.

- We should avoid underlining and italic, but can use bold and yellow highlighting. Some emoticons fine but don't overuse. Also, use bullets points. Do not change background, use default white.

- Try to avoid acronyms.

- In capitalize title casing the connection words should be lower case i.e. a, an, and, at, by, for, in, of, on, or, the, to, etc.

- Animals names should not be capitalized or foods.

- We can use parenthesis to add additional information in a sentence. Dashes better at interrupting and emphasizing an important point. Colons indicates what follow is an explanation, a description or a pertinent list of items.

- Use semicolon when comma is insufficient but colon or period is excessive. It serves the same function as an audible pause when speaking.

- We should try to use active voice instead of passive voice, as active voice is less wordy and more clear. But if the action is more important than subject then we can remove the subject from the sentence like "by the team" in below passive example. Passive voice is often preferred in scientific and technical writing.

- Try to avoid overused and unclear words – almost, basically, different, feel, good, just, large/small/long, never, new/old, very/really, thing(s). instead of using them, we should be more precise.

- It is the editing and proofreading the text which separates from the bad writer.

- Email should have amplification structure – beginning with a declared main idea, followed by supporting details and elaborations, and ending with logistics.

- Email is asynchronous communication and instant messaging is synchronous communication.

- Fast is fine, but accuracy is everything.

- We should different visuals like screenshots, icons, symbols, table, graphs and charts, flowcharts to make it easy to understand and engaging.

- Writing should be an expression of original thought. Using LLMs for creative tasks not only dilutes authenticity but also results in content that's often generic and uninspired. He concludes that if a task isn't worth genuine human effort, it's better left undone than delegated to a machine.

### Interview

- A good interview is like a good and informal chat between passionate developers. it is an exchange of information: a good debate about techniques, tools, challenges, and approaches to software development.

- As an interviewer we also need to sell the opportunity like the projects, team, company, perks, contribution impact, preparation, promptness, attitude and vibe, our stories.

- Interviewee's tell their experience in stories, concise answers, thoughtful questions, choice of words, body language and kindness.

- Don't ask many yes / no questions but open-ended questions like "tell me about a time when,", "tell me more about that project" or "how you solve this problem".

- We can ask the complex problem they have worked upon, any new technology how they will learn, any project or shared code or ask for any homework. And then ask questions based on that homework. We can first have panel interview then give homework then call.

- Sample Interview Questions -

  - How many technologies you have worked and how much you would rate each of these?
  - Which languages are you proficient in and could teach others?
  - Tell me about the users you have worked with? what do your users do that make you upset
  - How long have you worked with this language? what are the best and worst changes you have seen since started
  - If you were asked to present to a group of engineers about a particular technology, what would you present?
  - What technical projects do your do at home
  - If you had more time what technology you would study
  - What do you think of working with older technology
  - When you are learning a new technology, what process do you use to bring yourself up to speed
  - What do you do when you see a colleague is approaching a problem the wrong way? let them do it and learn, or...?
  - Do you read books? what are the last three books you have read?

- Illegal questions – age, religion, arrested, married, children, weight, personal finances, alcoholic, health, nationality, disabilities, military discharge.

### Professionalism

- High performance consultant would often arrive the next day with a solution to a problem that he'd managed to solve at home the night before.

- A consultant who handles this competence with difficulty, takes on too much and then finds it hard to admit that the workload is too much for him.

- Whether you are young professional, a student, or a CEO, understanding yourself is critical for becoming a better professional. It will help you enhance your strengths and improve your weakness to make you a better boss and a better colleague.

- Values act as our personal compass, helping us to navigate choices and decisions, both personally and professionally. Values are formed by your life experience.

  ![soft-skills-4-factors-of-trust](./images/soft-skills-4-factors-of-trust.png)

- Credibility is essential for hiring, promoting and trusting people. Those who end up establishing expertise are confident about showcasing their qualifications and achievements. The more we care about the success of others around us, the more they will trust us, paving the way for collaboration.

  ![soft-skill-trust-factors](./images/soft-skill-trust-factors.png)

- When a company lays off individual workers, it doesn't pick them at random. it lays off the least productive, least knowledgeable, and most senior (expensive, but also old) workers. these are workers which the company has unfortunate experience with, whose absence won't be felt.

- Now a day, the technology and hardware are not the bottlenecks but the people skill sets.

- Many developers still behave like unskilled, unmotivated workers, providing very poor service to their employers and clients.

- Companies are demanding professional software developers and not just cheap coders who do whatever they are told to do.

- Software development should be qualified as art, craft, trade, engineering, or science.

- Well-crafted software means that , regardless of how old the application is, developers can understand it easily. the side effects are well known and controlled. it has high and reliable test coverage, clear and simple design, and business language well expressed in the code.

- Software craftsmanship is a mindset – a lifestyle that many professional developers adopt. software craftsmen live and breathe software. they see software as a craft and are committed to do whatever they can to master their craft.

- When we say yes, people take that into account and make plans based on it. our bosses will make promises to their bosses, other teams, customers, or partners based on what we said. not being honest and transparent may cause huge damage to the entire team company.

- Always saying no is also not a professional attitude. every no, ideally, should be followed by a list of alternatives. remember the story of getting orange by two different persons with different approach.

- Craftsmen are gardeners. they are constantly looking after the code base, quickly refactoring it without fear – they are backed by a good battery of automated tests that can test the entire application in just few minutes.

- When a software craftsman makes recommendation, it is implied that the recommended developer is also a software craftsman, and that he or she shares the same passion, values, principles, and dedication.

- Clients may decide not to pay for quality and ask for a quick and cheap solution, but deep inside, they will always be expected quality and won't be happy if they don't get it.

- Well-crafted code is simple, small, testable, easy to understand, and most important, does the job.

- Software craftsmen are humble, always ready to learn from more-experienced developers and eager to help the less experienced.

- If you act without thinking, you are wasting the very edge that you have over machines. you are a candidate to being replaced in the near future (either by a thoughtful human or for a cheaper dumb machine). always try to understand what's the purpose of the task you've been assigned to. unless, of course, you want to become a bad developer.

- For me a good employee is one that is consistent. in other words they produce the same quality and quantity of work/results every day consistently. they are set and forget with little to no effort required from me or their supervisor. i don't need them to be a superstar. i am happy with them giving me 80% of what a superstar could give me in theory because i know i am always going to get it from them and i can more easily predict business/job outcomes as a result. the above employee tends to arrive on time and have less than average personal/sick leave too in my experience. by contrast, the mediocre employee is brilliant one day and off with the fairies for the next three days, then rounds out the week with a day off for a sprained eyelash! mediocre employees work output is up and down and hard to predict resulting in far more time spent supervising them. this adds cost and complexity to the business as a result. so if you want to impress a boss - work consistently. produce at the same level everyday and try and find ways to gradually improve or become more efficient.

- Working after hours a good idea if it must be urgent, important, and clearly defined. Then, it should also be an area of expertise, learning, or relationship building.

- A jack of all trades is a master of none, but often-times better than a master of one.

- If we do something extra over and beyond which we normally do early on that will help us build the trust, then we can reap onto it rest of the time of the relationship.

- Rebuilding credibility and reliability – coming to a meeting prepared, putting your point across and taking notes to share with other are great steps to rebuild credibility, be more knowledgeable, communicate confidently. For reliability, be punctual, dependable, consistent with action, avoid last minute surprises.

- Rebuilding openness and self-orientation – should have candid conversations about feedback or misunderstanding, give help people in small ways, be interesting in entire person (hobby, past things).

- "Debuggers don't remove bugs. They only show them in slow motion." Using a debugger doesn't scale. Types and tools and tests do.

- You should name a variable using the same care wit which you name a first-born child.

- It was the bad code that brought the company down.

- it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don't understand the risks of making messes.

- Clean code reads like well-written prose.

- It is not the language that makes programs appear simple. It is the programmer that make the language appear simple!

- One difference between a smart programmer and a professional programmer is that the professional understands that clarity is king. Professionals use their powers for good and write code that others can understand.

- Our real goal is to tell the story of the system, and that the function we write to fit cleanly together into a clear and precise language to help us with that telling.

- When people look under the hood, we want them to be impressed with the neatness, consistency, and attention to detail that they perceive. We want them to struck by the orderliness. We want them to perceive that professionals have been at work.

- The newspaper metaphor - think of a well-written newspaper article. you read it vertically. At the top you expect a headline that will tell you what the story is about and allows you to decide whether it is something you want to rad. the first paragraph gives you a synopsis of the whole story, hiding all the details while giving you broad-brush concepts. As you continue downward, the details increase until you have all the dates, names, quotes, claims, and other minutia. We would like a source file to be like a newspaper article.

- There is a reason that we keep our variables private. We don't want anyone else to depend on them. We want to keep the freedom to change their type of implementation on a whim or an impulse.

- Learning tests - in learning tests we call the third-party API, as we expect to use it in our application. we are essentially doing controlled experiments that check our understanding of that API. the tests focus on what we want out of the API.

- Cohesion - classes could have a small number of instance variables.

- Software systems are unique compared to physical systems. Their architectures can grow incrementally, if we maintain the proper separation of concerns.

- Writing clean concurrent programs is hard - very hard. it is much easier to write code that executes in a single thread.

- We should keep our concurrency-related code separator from other code.

- Keep synchronized sections small - locks are expensive because they create delays and add overhead. Also, avoid calling one locked section from another. This requires a deep understanding of whether something is or is not shared.

- Programming is a craft more than it is a science. To write clean code, you must first write dirty code and then clean it, it is called successive refinement. Most freshman programmers don't follow this advise particularly well. They believe that the primary goal is to get the program working. Once it is "working" they move on to the next task, leaving the "working" program in whatever state they finally to it to "work. Most seasoned programmers know that this is professional suicide.

- Refactoring is a lot like solving a Rubik's cube. There are lots of little steps required to achieve a large goal. Each step enables the next.

- Much of the good software design is simply about partitioning - creating appropriate places to put different kinds of code. This separation of concerns make the code much simpler to understand and maintain.

- Each of us has the responsiblity to leave the code a little better than we found it.

- We should take pains to minimize both the number and extend of extra languages in our source files.

- You don't become a software craftsman by learning a list of heuristics. Professionalism and craftsmanship come from values that drive disciplines.

- AI killed the curious star - we are giving up our creativity to make things more convenient. it is what fast food did to us.

- Keep your eyes open for new programming languages, tools, and ways of working that might improve your company's development process. Don't be afraid to ask the team to try new stuff, or to try it on your own so you can show them how valuable a new tool can be. Learn about the company's business, who its customers are, how the product is sold, and what products you compete against. Competitors have good ideas too, ideas you can incorporate in your next feature.

- Be a mentor to a new team member. Help everybody do their best work. The nail that sticks up, gets hammered down." Don't stick up. When the company considers employees to lay off, it's the ones that require management that get let go. The easy ones get to stay. While doing this, keep up to date on tools and methods, because you never know when you will need to find a new job. This increases your value to the next employer.

- We have now become a lego builder not a programmer after using so much of frameworks.

- The code should be easy to modify as requirements change.

- Use astro framework for a content heavy fast website

- Display technologies - lcd, led and micro led

- Engineers used to give complex names for the technology but under the hood it is very simple and have same base concept.

- WordPress is an open-source, free platform for building and developing websites. WordPress is the most user-friendly and efficient blogging and website builder on the market right now.

- We should not create any features of functionality when we are carrying out the refactoring process.

- Event based learnings (like office training) vs continuous learnings (like from pluralsight).

- Freemium – providing a free, basic version of the app with the option to upgrade to a premium, paid version.

- Writing clean code is what you must do in order to call yourself a professional. There is no reasonable excuse for doing anything less than your best.

### Speaking

- Enunciate – speak the words clearly.

- Just being chatty is not same as being open. The attributes of openness are vulnerability, transparency and maintaining confidentiality.

- During presentation instead of saying word um… just use silence.

- Update in a stand-up meeting is to talk about what you did yesterday, what you will do today, and if there are any blockers. Even if you don't have any PR or documentation ready, don't be afraid to discuss what you did yesterday. It includes telling the team that you are spending time trying to understand the new architecture or the product definition for the entire day. The manager wants to know whether or not you are blocked during this status update. However, most importantly, they want to hear the delta of what you did yesterday compared to today. A status update is a good environment to reiterate your efforts on the project and set timeline expectations, such as any delays in the project delivery. Create a short summary list before the status update.

  1. What did I do? - Research on System X and Product Spec Y. Found out that System X requires IT approval.
  1. What will I do? - Look into the codebase of architecture X. Does anyone know which repository I should start with or who the owner of system X is?
  1. Blockers - No Blockers for now

- Gobbledygook – intentionally meaningless language – we deliberately use unclear language so that general people don't understand it and won't raise any counter question.

### Listening

- Put yourself into other person shoe to reduce self-orientation, be fully present while listening.

- Don't interrupt the other person while they are speaking - by your interruption, you're insinuating that your thoughts and ideas are more important than theirs."

## Wellness

### Food

- Things should not eat when on vacation - Raw or undercooked foods, Dairy / soft cheeses / unpasteurized milk and related dairy-based items, Possibly desserts or items with unfamiliar or uncommon ingredients. Try to avoid risky choices: pick places with good reviews, clean kitchens, local busy eateries over tourist traps, well-cooked food, etc.

- Beer is the worst drink to have

- To prevent cancer, simply avoid stress, tobacco and opt for a clean diet

- Do not drink any type of juice, always have whole fruit or vegetable

- Unfortunately, the least healthy foods usually offer the most comfort.

- We should never ask our children, instead we should tell them what they will be eating for dinner – a steady, simple and nutritious meal.

- Ayurveda rejects the stale, easy, ready-in-a-minute choices in the urban world and encourages all things natural.

### Exercise

- I'm 79, walk about 6km almost daily. Stick to healthy meals. Don't eat much. Very seldom eat in between. That's if I can even manage 3 meals! I don't have any health problems as yet. Good genes. Also, God looks after me.

- Scientists discovered that your body doesn’t just slow down slowly as you get older. instead, there are two big "jumps" in how things inside your body change. around age 44 and 60. 40s how your body handles alcohol, caffeine, fats, muscle, heart, and skin. 60s how your body handles sugars, your immune system, kidneys, plus some of the same stuff from your 40s (heart, muscle, skin). these big changes could be why growing older sometimes feels like suddenly everything is different or harder.

- I want to live well for as long as possible. I don’t want to be the old man who can’t carry his groceries in from the car at 80.

- I like to look good. I’m 60 and I’ve noticed that other guys my age are starting to look less and less like MEN. Their faces are sagging, their shoulders slope and their bellies hang out. Screw that! It doesn’t need to be that way!

- Easy ways to stay healthy everyday. Go for an early morning walk. Enjoy the fresh air, cool breeze and nature.

- Our body has amazing cleansing capabilities. We poop, pee, burp, fart, sweat, vomit, tear up, salivate, and many other internal organs that keep us as healthy as possible. All we really have to do is keep doing what aids these natural processes.

- No treatment in the world will have even as remotely similar results as regular exercise. This is the silver bullet for your health. Your construction crew will repair everything in your body from injuries, sicknesses, inflammation to cancer cells. In fact, the "crew" will keep your body in such good shape that it will prevent 99% of afflictions.

### Socializing

- The worst thing that can happen to any parent is to lose a child. To even think you lost a child is enough to send any man or woman to an early grave. You cannot rest. You cannot calm down. You cannot find peace until you know where your child is, whether your child is an infant or an adult, it doesn’t matter. If you do ever feel like disappearing from the world, at least let your family know where you are, don’t leave them in the dark — it could quite literally kill your parents, not to know if you’re safe.

- Any loan provider asking for money before disbursing a loan is fraudulent. Banks and NBFCs deduct processing fees from the sanctioned amount rather than requiring upfront payments.

- It is not the finances that should scare you, it is the loneliness and illness during your sunset years

- Surround yourself with good friends.

- Create events in life - every month should have 4 normal event and 1 big event, year should have 7 to 8 big events like birthday and anniversary in the household, holi and diwali

- What screams "I'm upper class"?
  - Demeanor and self-confidence at the earliest age. Upbringing. Widely traveled. Adult conversations. Exposed to family engaged in difficult conversations and people in leadership positions at a young age.
  - Speech. Crisp enunciation. Wide vocabulary without pretentiousness.
  - Attire. Simple. Tasteful. Minimal jewelry. Always clean and quality.
  - Financial. Never talk about money or wealth, as if it doesn’t matter. Carefree concerns about anything financial. Someone else worries about financial details.
  - Cars, Yachts, McMansions, and other symbols of wealth. Not usually. Couldn’t care less about displaying wealth. Family car might very well be a quality 8 year old car or SUV. Prefer to invest rather than spend their money. If personally active in sports, then the sport will likely involve small balls (golf/tennis) and not big balls (football/basketball/bowling), and/or considerable money to participate (alpine skiing, horses or sailing)

### Philosophies

> Slo trip is not recommended irrespective of age, country.

- Jealousy is better but not hatred.

- "At the end of the day, money is ultimately unimportant" to be less convincing when they are coming from people with a net worth in the hundreds of millions or more. "Wealth is meaningless" I scream at the beggar from my mansion's window.

- Useless Skill that Smart People Value - Deep reading - reading long-form, complex texts, books rather than short snippets, Sustained attention / focus - being able to resist distractions, concentrate for a long stretch, Thinking deeply / reflection - not just scanning info, but pondering, integrating, making connections.

- The US considers India a country on the menu. Not at the table. India made the mistake of not being fully aligned with the Western powers. Modi is not seen as a faithful 19th century Indian housekeeper/ butler, but a traitor and opportunist. So at this point nobody is willing to support or work with India.

- Never seen a Vietnamese person admit their mistake. As long as you don't admit making a mistake, you don't have to make any changes. Vietnamese, you are the best example, constantly searching for small or individual flaws in others, as an excuse to not strictly demand oneself or even rationalize one's own mistakes. You can't possibly become East Asians.

- Choosing the easiest and fastest way to do things—like using apps to get food, rides, or play games—can actually make life less fun and meaningful. When we rely on machines or apps too much, we don’t learn important skills or try new things. We spend less time with friends and family, which can make us feel lonely. Doing things the “hard way” sometimes, like cooking, playing outside, or helping someone, makes life more interesting and our culture stronger. Don’t always take the easy way—try to do things yourself sometimes, and enjoy the experience!

- I suggest you live by the campfire rule. Leave a place the same, or nicer than you found it.

- Every single middle-class family's most important thing is their dreams and that is their Child's future.

- Boys have learnt to cook and girls have learnt to earn thereby rendering the concept of marriage as irrelevant and obsolete.

- The British robbed India’s soul, and made Indians aspire to be second class Brits, serving Western Masters and interests as the norm. Indians don’t know who they are or should be, and are susceptible to charlatans leading them down a seemingly gilded path.

- The biggest mistake which couples make after a few years of marriage is: They treat each other as a punching bag to deal with all the frustrations in the world. And once they are relieved, they realize their mistake and simply apologize. Slowly, this negativity gives rise to a disturbed relationship affecting attraction and love towards each other. And then the journey of togetherness becomes a mere compulsion.

- Don't get triggered very easily and avoid sitting on barood all the time

- Japanese developers write code like real-life ninjas—quiet, precise, and super focused. It may take longer, but the result is strong, clean, and long-lasting! What Can You Learn From Them? Slow down. Do it right the first time. Keep your work neat and simple. Always look for ways to improve. Be proud of what you build—even if no one’s watching. Fix mistakes early instead of waiting for trouble. What Makes Them Special? They treat coding like art. Like painting or making origami. They don’t just "get it done"—they try to make it beautiful and just right. They don’t rush. Instead of writing messy code quickly, they write it slowly, carefully, and cleanly—so it works for a long, long time. They fix problems early. They use smart tricks to stop mistakes before they even happen, kind of like putting guardrails on a slide. They like simple stuff. Their code looks neat and clean, like a tidy room with no toys on the floor. They always try to improve. Even after finishing something, they ask, “How can I do it better next time?” That’s called Kaizen—always getting better!

- What are the 10 things required for a quality life? Being in tip-top shape, Having a safety fund, having a tidy house, Wake up early, Having a full fridge of mainly healthy food, Good relationships with family and friends, Enjoying good food, Listening to music

- Great programmers don't just type fast—they think smart. They imagine problems before they happen, and fix them early. So, to be a better programmer, treat your brain like a mini detective. Ask questions, think through your code like a puzzle, and try to spot mistakes before the computer does.

- Must wake up early - Not at 7. Not at 6. When it’s still dark and quiet, that’s when they rise. Because power is built before the world opens its eyes.

- Move like a weapon. Push your body. Sweat early. Because weakness leaves the body through movement. You can’t be mentally dangerous in a physically lazy shell.

- Read like it’s armour. 10 pages. Every morning. They feed the mind like it’s part of the job. Because it is. The ignorant are predictable. Dangerous people aren’t.

- Block time like a fortress. The first 90 minutes are off-limits. No meetings. No calls. No noise. They use that time to execute, while others warm up.

- Cold water. No excuses. Hydrate. Shower. Shock the system. Wake up with discipline, not dopamine.

- Eat like it’s fuel, not fun. No sugar rush. No heavy crash. They eat to stay sharp, not to escape. What you feed your body is how your brain behaves.

- Set targets, not to-do lists. They don’t write down “tasks.” They write down kills. Objectives. Moves. A day without a target is a day given to someone else.

- Guard the gate. No random content. No emotional leaks. Their inputs are curated. Focused. Controlled. Because in a noisy world, clarity is power.

- When You Start Making Good Money, Do this - Buy fewer clothes, but wear the highest quality, Eat premium food, not junk, Hire a helper for household chores. Buy back your time, Surround yourself with high-value people.

- The best way to avoid mid-life crisis is to keep on inventing and creating challenges before you. So long as the life is full of challenges, there is no scope for mid-life crisis to invade your life. Any life devoid of goals and challenges is a life of crisis only.

- Revenge is a dish best served with a well-timed.

- Just like building a toy or drawing a picture, working a little each day, listening to feedback, and focusing on making something helpful can lead to something amazing.

- Build your dreams or someone else will hire you to build theirs.

- Rule No 1:- Find your Niche, Rule No 2:- Set your Goals, Rule No 3 :- Slog your a\*\* off and stop discussions on Politics or Religion for the next 20 years, Rule No 4:- Stop feeling sorry for yourself or expecting sympathy. Instead hope for humiliation so that it is driven into you, You may not become a great success but you will no longer feel inferior, You will feel like someone who has DONE HIS BEST and anyone who has done his best , can never feel inferior. ACT LIKE AN INDIAN, THINK LIKE A CHINESE !!!!

- Signs someone has self respect? they speak up, they follow through on what they say they are going to do, their priorities are clear and they live by them, they say no kindly and without equivocation, they do not put up with a lack of clarity, a lack of certainty or a sense that they are not being valued, when you catch a glimpse of their inner dialogue it’s full of compassion, they have self awareness, there is a sense of integration and alignment: words align with actions, actions align with priorities.

- Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes. Oscan Wilde.

- The early bird catches the worm. Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today.

- Bertrand Russell: "the fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt."

- Be tough on the process, but gentle on the output - you need to set aside time to write and that is where you cannot be easy on yourself. you need to follow the process. if you plan to write for two hours every day, do that. if you wake up at 5 and your process is to be at your desk by 5:30 and you feel like sleeping in, that's the time to be tough on yourself. protect the process of writing every day.

- You can go fast or go far. not both.

- Mind is made for processing of things not for remind them. so note down everything which are important to you.

- The nature of water is dry and sharp. it slowly pulls natural oils from our skin, which is naturally unctuous in its healthy state. that is why ayurveda advises us to oil our bodies before rinsing with water.

- Life is very short and anxious for those who forget the past, neglect the present, and fear the future.

- What would have happened, doctor if you died first, and your wife would have had to survive you?

- Don't try to see god. act in such a way that god will see you.

- Many japanese people never really retire – they keep doing what they love for as long as their health allows.

- The greater the stress, the greater the degenerative effect on cells.

- If you keep moving with your fingers working, 100 years will come to you.

- Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute and it seems like an hour. sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute. that is relativity.

- Flow state is when pleasure, delight, creativity, and process when we are completely immersed in life.

- We often think that combing tasks will save us time, but scientific evidence shows that it has the opposite effect.

- Food won't help you live longer. the secret is smiling and having a good time. to live a long time you need to do three things: exercise to stay healthy, eat well and spend time with people.

- The things we love are like the leaves of a tree: they can fall at any moment with a gust of wind.

- We should never forget what a privilege it is to be in the here and now in a world so full of possibilities.

- The Being John Malkovich movie is based on body-mind problem

- Consciousness is a terrible curse. I think. I feel. I suffer

- When you have power without responsiblity, that is a recipe for a bad governance

- Movies have time pressure as essence just like water and sky have blue as essence

- Walk (create manufacturing assembly line) -> run (create components) -> sprint (create own branding)

- It's weird, i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but at the same time i would love that every single person watches this masterpiece.

- India loves thrown body at problems - classic poor management strategy. engineering is quite the opposite.

- Avoid referring to colleagues or friends as family members; maintain the relationship as it is without altering it. For instance, let a father remain a father and not become a friend

- Those who are genuine and focused are not affected by the evil eye, whereas individuals who are insecure, show off, and lack authenticity may attract it.

- The degree to which other people want to work with you is a direct indication of how successful you'll be in your career as an engineer. be the engineer that everyone wants to work with.

- Discipline may be necessary, as without discipline, there can be no order in society and no social progress would be possible. however, too much discipline tends to reduce human rationality and kills creativity, innovation, humanity, love and compassion. the best course is, therefore, to educate and develop rational thinking in the people to cultivate self-discipline so that they are driven to do the right things due to their inner conviction rather than due to the fear of authority.

- The cow does not give milk. "What are you saying?" Asked the boy incredulously. As you hear it, son: The cow does not give milk, you have to milk it. You have to get up at 4 in the morning, go to the field, walk through the corral full of manure, tie the tail, hobble the legs of the cow, sit on the stool, place the bucket and do the work yourself. That is the secret of life, the cow does not give milk. You milk her or you don't get milk. There is this generation that thinks that cows GIVE milk. That things are automatic and free: their mentality is that if "I wish, I ask..... I obtain." 'They have been accustomed to get whatever they want the easy way...But no, life is not a matter of wishing, asking and obtaining. The things that one receives are the effort of what one does. Happiness is the result of effort. Lack of effort creates frustration." "Cows don't give milk; you have to work for it."

- Indians are very touchy about their place in history and world. Instead of working hard to better their country, most people prefer to belittle others achievement and have false delusions to feel good about themselves.

- RDR2 - Revenge is a luxury we can't afford.

- Animal rewarded for good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior. Later studies have shown that the same applies to humans.

- A dog is the only animal that doesn't have to work for a living? A hen has to lay eggs, a cow has to give milk, and a canary has to sing. But a dog makes his living by giving you nothing but love.

- When you're young and a summer lasts forever, and the school year lasts eternity to the 10th, it's because your perception of time is marked by new events….almost everything is new, so your brain is constantly marking events as passages of time. we cram a lot of events into short passages of time. when we're youth challenged, there just aren't that many new events… it's not new to go to work, come home, clean, go to bed, go shopping and talk to the cashier… we've done this thousands of times. so the event markers are spaced farther and farther apart. we need to mark new events… do new things. the more often we do them, the more our perception of time slows down.

- Be a modern renaissance man. jacked, intellectual, romantic, artistic and ambitious.

- It's not the strongest or smartest who survive, it's the ones who are most adaptable to the changing environment.

- Old age came a lot faster than i expected! now to answer when i started to feel old. i think it was when my body started to break down. first it was high blood pressure, and then knee replacements, hearing loss, a-fib, more heart problems, and weight gain. it became more and more difficult to go places and do things. if i were given the opportunity to live the last 10–15 years over, i would not allow myself to put on extra weight and i would not stop exercising, something i stopped doing when i retired. i am sure i would feel a lot younger even with my health problems.

- Europeans appreciate healthier and tastier food, better choices of shopping and traveling, higher quality of education and healthcare, etc.

- Only those who become "spreadsheet managers" become redundant. Everyone should exercise (and I don't just mean physical exercise). Always ask the following questions to yourself: Am I expensive? Is there anyone junior and cheaper who can do my job equally well? Do I bring value for the salary paid to me? Am I ready to take up a new role? Does the company believe that I can take up a new role? If you have positive responses to the above, you can last way beyond 45. Else you will not even last that long.

- Pretentiousness doesn't impress me, being genuine does.

- Diabetes happens not because sugar but high carbs food

- Nobody starts from Scratch - Sometimes it is good to remember that nobody starts from scratch, not at least since the Big Bang event approx.13.8 Billion years ago. Everything, all adventures, stories, landscapes, trails, experiences and cultures builds on something, good or bad, something that was all-ready there.

- Therefore, I advise foreigners who travel to China: China is not America, nor is it Europe. When traveling to China, you must abide by China's rules and do not bring your own domineering ways in other countries to China. Respecting the elderly is a part of Chinese Confucian culture. In China, you should respect the elderly. Don't push old people who are smaller than you. The elderly in China are different from the elderly in wheelchairs in your country. They have strong hands and feet, are healthy, and know Kung Fu.

- For fulfilling life - I've said many times, "I'm not the smartest guy in the room but if I develop a routine I can accomplish anything." And that's paid off big time in life.

  1. Marriage. Ok, that doesn't sound romantic. My wife and I, purposely, catch up every day. While we walk and have dinner together. Oh, and other things. And that's paid off big time in romance.
  2. Family. While our kids were growing up I rarely watched TV. Instead, we talked over dinner and enjoyed family activities. And that's paid off big time in our relationships.
  3. Food. I know what works in my body so I eat the same diet every day. Boring? I find feeling crappy boring. And that's paid off big time in health.
  4. Exercise. I exercise every day. Walking, karate, yard work (not my favorite). And I stretch and strengthen. Boring? Sometimes. Yet, it's paid off big time in vitality.
  5. Gratitude. Every morning, while getting ready, I give thanks for everything I have. No TV, phones or emails. Just gratitude. And that's paid off big time in happiness.
  6. Prayer. Every morning, while having breakfast, I pray for those I love and everything I need. Boring? Never. Every day I expect the best. And it's paid off big time receiving it.
  7. Saving. My wife and I have saved for retirement since we married. Often a real sacrifice when we had little. Boring? Often. And it's paid off big time in savings.
  8. Investing. I'm not smart enough to time the market or discover hot investments. So I just keep investing broadly. Boring? Sure. But I like boring investing. And it's paid off big time in wealth.
  9. Growing. Every day I do something to grow. Reading, listening, watching something that causes me to think and discover. Boring? Never. And it's paid off big time in knowledge.
  10. Giving. I try to give every day to my family, friends, clients, non-profits and readers. Never boring. Constantly rewarding. And it's paid off big time in fulfillment.

- There is one, and only one sin that God does not, indeed cannot forgive, and that is any sin that no forgiveness is sought for. It’s not because God is powerless to do so, or unwilling to do so, but because He will not override our free will. He won’t force his grace and mercy on us if we decide we don’t want it. If someone decides they don’t want or need forgiveness, God will let them go on, patiently waiting for them to seek his mercy. Every sin is forgivable by God, and nobody is beyond the reach of His mercy.

- Imagine you’re staring out the window, thinking about flying dragons, magical forests, or becoming a superhero. That’s called daydreaming—it’s like letting your mind play and imagine fun things, even if they aren’t real. This article says that people today don’t daydream as much anymore. Why? Because we’re always looking at our phones, watching videos, or scrolling through apps. Our brains don’t get bored enough to just imagine things on their own. But being bored is actually good sometimes—it helps our imagination grow! The writer is worried that kids and adults are forgetting how to let their minds wander and create fun stories inside their heads. He thinks daydreaming is important because it helps us become more creative, kind, and thoughtful. Put the phone down sometimes. Stare out the window. Let your brain go on a little adventure all by itself.

### Science

- One calorie of heat energy is the amount of energy that is required to raise the temperature of 1g of water from 14.5 degree Celsius to 15.5 degree Celsius.

- Temperature is defined as a parameter that helps us define the level of hotness or coldness of its body.

- The quantity of heat that is absorbed by a body is generally dependent on three factors, which are as follows – mass, increase in temperature, material.

- Not all the materials can have transfer of heat through this process, for example, plastic. Such material called insulators. Conductors are known to carry heat easily because of their low specific heat capacities.

- The process of heat transfer through a vacuum is called radiation.

- Motion is a combined outcome of a body under observation and the observer.

- Magnetism – The core of the earth was made from iron, while the planet itself was a magnet, which he quoted to be the reason for compasses to point to the north. The unit of the strength of a magnetic field is Tesla. Magnet types – permanent, temporary and electromagnets. A current-carrying wire produces a magnetic field around it. Magnet uses – scrap lifting, surgical extraction, dc motor, ac generators. The payment card strip is made of magnet, audio cassette, CRT's monitor, speaker system. Over-exposure to static magnetic fields can be harmful to our health.
